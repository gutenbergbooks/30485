<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>STRANGE BARGAININGS</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>When a man came down out of the mountains
looking dusty and gaunt as the stranger did,
there was no marvel in the matter of his eating five
cans of cove oysters. The one unaccountable thing
about it was that Saul Chadron, president of the
Drovers&rsquo; Association, should sit there at the table
and urge the lank, lean starveling to go his limit.</p>
<p>Usually Saul Chadron was a man who picked his
companions, and was a particular hand at the
choosing. He could afford to do that, being of
the earth&rsquo;s exalted in the Northwest, where people
came to him and put down their tribute at his feet.</p>
<p>This stranger, whom Chadron treated like a long-wandering
friend, had come down the mountain trail
that morning, and had been hanging about the
hotel all day. Buck Snellin, the proprietor&mdash;duly
licensed for a matter of thirty years past by the
United States government to conduct his hostelry in
the corner of the Indian reservation, up against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' ></a>2</span>
door of the army post&mdash;did not know him. That
threw him among strangers in that land, indeed, for
Buck knew everybody within a hundred miles on every
side.</p>
<p>The stranger was a tall, smoky man, hollow-faced,
grim; adorned with a large brown mustache which
drooped over his thin mouth; a bony man with
sharp shoulders, and a stoop which began in the
region of the stomach, as if induced by drawing in
upon himself in times of poignant hunger, which he
must have felt frequently in his day to wear him down
to that state of bones; with the under lid of his left
eye caught at a point and drawn down until it showed
red, as if held by a fishhook to drain it of unimaginable
tears.</p>
<p>There was a furtive look in his restless, wild-animal
eyes, smoky like the rest of him, and a surliness about
his long, high-ridged nose which came down over his
mustache like a beak. He wore a cloth cap with ear
flaps, and they were down, although the heat of
summer still made the September air lively enough
for one with blood beneath his skin. He regaled himself
with fierce defiance, like a captive eagle, and had
no word in return for the generous importunities of
the man who was host to him in what evidently was a
long-deferred meal.</p>
<p>Chadron paid the bill when the man at last finished
packing his internal cavities, and they went together
into the hotel office which adjoined the dining-room.</p>
<p>The office of this log hotel was a large, gaunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' ></a>3</span>
room, containing a few chairs along the walls, a small,
round table under the window with the register upon
it, a pen in a potato, and a bottle of ink with trickled
and encrusted sides. The broad fireplace was bleak
and black, blank-staring as a blind eye, and the sun
reached through the window in a white streak across
the mottled floor.</p>
<p>There was the smell of old pipes, old furs, old
guns, in the place, and all of them were present to
account for themselves and dispel any shadow of
mystery whatever&mdash;the guns on their pegs set in
auger-holes in the logs of the walls, the furs of wild
beasts dangling from like supports in profusion
everywhere, and the pipes lying on the mantel with
stems hospitably extended to all unprovided guests.
Some of them had been smoked by the guests who
had come and gone for a generation of men.</p>
<p>The stranger stood at the manteltree and tried the
pipes&rsquo; capacity with his thick-ended thumb, finding
one at last to his requirements. Tall as Saul
Chadron stood on his own proper legs, the stranger
at his shoulder was a head above him. Seven feet he
must have towered, his crown within a few inches of
the smoked beams across the ceiling, and marvelously
thin in the running up. It seemed that the wind
must break him some blustering day at that place in
his long body where hunger, or pain, or mischance
had doubled him over in the past, and left him
creased. The strong light of the room found pepperings
of gray in his thick and long black hair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' ></a>4</span></div>
<p>Chadron himself was a gray man, with a mustache
and beard like a cavalier. His shrewd eyes were
sharp and bright under heavy brows, his brown face
was toughened by days in the saddle through all seasons
of weather and wind. His shoulders were broad
and heavy, and even now, although not dressed for
the saddle, there was an up-creeping in the legs of
his trousers, and a gathering at the knees of them,
for they were drawn down over his tall boots.</p>
<p>That was Chadron&rsquo;s way of doing the nice thing
when he went abroad in his buckboard. He had
saddle manners and buckboard manners, and even
office manners when he met the cattle barons in Cheyenne.
No matter what manners he chanced to be
wearing, one remembered Saul Chadron after meeting
him, and carried the recollection of him to the
sundown of his day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk here,&rdquo; said Chadron, giving the other
a cigar.</p>
<p>The tall man broke the cigar and ground part of it
in his palm, looking with frowning thoughtfulness
into the empty fireplace as the tobacco crushed in his
hard hand. He filled the pipe that he had chosen,
and sat with his long legs stretched out toward the
chimney-mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on and talk,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>His voice came smothered and hoarse, as if it lay
beneath all the oysters which he had rammed into his
unseen hollow. It was a voice in strange harmony
with the man, such a sound as one would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' ></a>5</span>
expected to come out of that surly, dark-lipped, thin
mouth. There was nothing committal about it, nothing
exactly identifying; an impersonal voice, rather,
and cold; a voice with no conscience behind it,
scarcely a soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a business man, Mark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Mark, grunting a little cloud of
smoke from the bowl of his pipe in his sarcastic
vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; continued Chadron, unmoved.
&ldquo;Words between us would be a waste of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right; money talks,&rdquo; said Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s job, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have called you
out of your hole to do it,&rdquo; said Chadron, watching
the man slyly for the effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay me in money,&rdquo; suggested Mark, unwarmed
by the compliment. &ldquo;Is it nesters ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nesters,&rdquo; nodded the cattleman, drawing his
great brows in a frown. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re crowdin&rsquo; in so
thick right around me that I can&rsquo;t breathe comfortable
any more; the smell of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s in the wind.
They&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; over three of the biggest ranches up
here besides the Alamito, and the Drovers&rsquo; Association
wants a little of your old-time holy scare throwed
into the cussed coyotes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark nodded in the pause which seemed to have
been made for him to nod, and Chadron went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We figger that if a dozen or two of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s cleaned
out, quick and mysterious, the rest&rsquo;ll tuck tail and
sneak. It&rsquo;s happened that way in other places more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' ></a>6</span>
than once, as you and I know. Well, you&rsquo;re the man
that don&rsquo;t have to take lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money talks,&rdquo; repeated Mark, still looking into
the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s about twenty of them that counts, the
rest&rsquo;s the kind you can drive over a cliff with a whip.
These fellers has strung their cussed bob-wire fences
crisscross and checkerboard all around there up the
river, and they&rsquo;re gittin&rsquo; to be right troublesome.
Of course they&rsquo;re only a speck up there yet, but
they&rsquo;ll multiply like fleas on a hot dog if we let &rsquo;em
go ahead. You know how it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a conclusiveness in Chadron&rsquo;s tone as
he said that. It spoke of a large understanding
between men of a kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grunted the man Mark, nodding his head
at the chimney. &ldquo;You want a man to work from
the willers, without no muss or gun-flashin&rsquo;, or rough
houses or loud talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty of them, their names are here, and some
scattered in between that I haven&rsquo;t put down, to be
picked up as they fall in handy, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re aimin&rsquo; to keep clear, and stand back
in the shadder, like you always have done,&rdquo; growled
Mark. &ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to ram my neck into no
sheriff&rsquo;s loop for nobody&rsquo;s business but my own from
now on. I&rsquo;m through with resks, just to be
obligin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll put a hand on you in this country unless
we give the word?&rdquo; Chadron asked, severely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' ></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know who&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; the law in this dang
country now? Maybe you fellers is, maybe you
ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law in this part of the country bigger
than the Drovers&rsquo; Association,&rdquo; Chadron told him,
frowning in rebuke of Mark&rsquo;s doubt of security.
&ldquo;Well, maybe there&rsquo;s a little sheriff here and there,
and a few judges that we didn&rsquo;t put in, but they&rsquo;re
down in the farmin&rsquo; country, and they don&rsquo;t cut no
figger at all. If you <i>was</i> fool enough to let one of
them fellers git a hold on you we wouldn&rsquo;t leave you
in jail over night. You know how it was up there in
the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know how it is down here.&rdquo; Mark
scowled in surly unbelief, or surly simulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a judge, federal or state, that could
carry a bale of hay anywhere in the cattle country,
I tell you, Mark, that we don&rsquo;t draw the chalk line
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you do the job yourselves, &rsquo;stead
of callin&rsquo; a peaceable man away from his ranchin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one kind of a gentleman, Mark, and I&rsquo;m
another, and there&rsquo;s different jobs for different men.
That ain&rsquo;t my line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hell!&rdquo; said Mark, laying upon the words an
eloquent stress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve got to do is keep clear of the reservation;
don&rsquo;t turn a card here, no matter how easy it
looks. We can&rsquo;t jerk you out of the hands of the
army if you git mixed up with it; that&rsquo;s one place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' ></a>8</span>
where we stop. The reservation&rsquo;s a middle ground
where we meet the nesters&mdash;rustlers, every muddy-bellied
wolf of &rsquo;em, and we can prove it&mdash;and pass
&rsquo;em by. They come and go here like white men, and
nothing said. Keep clear of the reservation; that&rsquo;s
all you&rsquo;ve got to do to be as safe as if you was layin&rsquo;
in bed on your ranch up in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron winked as he named that refuge of the
hunted in the Northwest. Mark appeared to be
considering something weightily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if they&rsquo;re rustlers&mdash;nobody ain&rsquo;t got
no use for a rustler,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s men in that bunch of twenty&rdquo;&mdash;tapping
the slip of paper with his finger&mdash;&ldquo;that started
with two cows a couple of years ago that&rsquo;s got fifty
and sixty head of two-year-olds now,&rdquo; Chadron feelingly
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much&rsquo;re you willin&rsquo; to go?&rdquo; Mark put the
question with a suddenness which seemed to betray
that he had been saving it to shoot off that way, as a
disagreeable point over which he expected a quarrel.
He squinted his draggled left eye at Chadron, as if he
was taking aim, while he waited for a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have done it for fifty a head,&rdquo; Chadron
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things is higher now, and I&rsquo;m older, and the
resk&rsquo;s bigger,&rdquo; Mark complained. &ldquo;How fur apart
do they lay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to get around in a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that ain&rsquo;t figgerin&rsquo; the time a feller has to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' ></a>9</span>
lay out in the bresh waitin&rsquo; and takin&rsquo; rheumatiz in
his j&rsquo;ints. I couldn&rsquo;t touch the job for the old figger;
things is higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mark&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron opened the slip
which he had wound round his finger&mdash;&ldquo;this one is
worth ten, yes, all, the others. Make your own price
on him. But I want it <i>done</i>; no bungled job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark took the paper and laid his pipe aside while
he studied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alan Macdonald,&rdquo; nodded Chadron. &ldquo;That
feller&rsquo;s opened a ditch from the river up there on my
land and begun to <i>irrigate!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irrigatin&rsquo;, huh?&rdquo; said Mark, abstractedly,
moving his finger down the column of names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes a blind of buyin&rsquo; up cattle and fattenin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em on the hay and alfalfer he&rsquo;s raisin&rsquo; up there
on my good land, but he&rsquo;s the king-pin of the
rustlers in this corner of the state. He&rsquo;ll be in here
tomorrow with cattle for the Indian agent&mdash;it&rsquo;s beef
day&mdash;and you can size him up. But you&rsquo;ve got to
keep your belly to the ground like a snake when you
start anything on that feller, and you&rsquo;ve got to make
sure you&rsquo;ve got him dead to rights. He&rsquo;s quick with
a gun, and he&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred?&rdquo; suggested Mark, with a crafty
sidelong look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve named it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And something down for expenses; a feller&rsquo;s got
to live, and livin&rsquo;s high.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' ></a>10</span></div>
<p>Chadron drew out his wallet. Money passed into
Mark&rsquo;s hand, and he put it away in his pocket along
with the list of names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the old place in Cheyenne for the
settlement, if you make good,&rdquo; Chadron told him.</p>
<p>Mark waved his hand in lofty depreciation of the
hint that failure for him was a possible contingency.
He said no more. For a little while Chadron stood
looking down on him as he leaned with his pipe over
the dead ashes in the fireplace, his hand in the breast
of his coat, where he had stored his purse. Mark
treated the mighty cattleman as if he had become a
stranger to him, along with the rest of the world in
that place, and Chadron turned and went his way.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>BEEF DAY</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Fort Shakie was on its downhill way in those
days, and almost at the bottom of the decline.
It was considered a post of penance by enlisted men
and officers alike, nested up there in the high plateau
against the mountains in its place of wild beauty and
picturesque charm.</p>
<p>But natural beauty and Indian picturesqueness do
not fill the place in the soldierly breast of fair civilian
lady faces, nor torrential streams of cold mountain
water supply the music of the locomotive&rsquo;s toot.
Fort Shakie was being crept upon by civilization,
true, but it was coming all too slow for the booted
troopers and belted officers who must wear away the
months in its lonely silences.</p>
<p>Within the memory of officers not yet gray the
post had been a hundred and fifty miles from a railroad.
Now it was but twenty; but even that short
leap drowned the voice of the locomotive, and the
dot at the rails&rsquo; end held few of the endearments
which make soldiering sweet.</p>
<p>Soon the post must go, indeed, for the need of it
had passed. The Shoshones, Arapahoes, and Crows
had forgotten their old animosities, and were traveling
with Buffalo Bill, going to college, and raising
alfalfa under the direction of a government farmer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' ></a>12</span>
The Indian police were in training to do the soldiers&rsquo;
work there. Soon the post must stand abandoned,
a lonely monument to the days of hard riding, long
watches, and bleak years. Not a soldier in the
service but prayed for the hastening of the day.</p>
<p>No, there was not much over at Meander, at the
railroad&rsquo;s end, to cheer a soldier&rsquo;s heart. It was an
inspiring ride, in these autumn days, to come to
Meander, past the little brimming lakes, which
seemed to lie without banks in the green meadows
where wild elk fed with the shy Indian cattle; over
the white hills where the earth gave under the hoofs
like new-fallen snow. But when one came to it
through the expanding, dusty miles, the reward of his
long ride was not in keeping with his effort.</p>
<p>Certainly, privates and subalterns could get drunk
there, as speedily as in the centers of refinement, but
there were no gentlemanly diversions at which an
officer could dispel the gloom of his sour days in
garrison.</p>
<p>The rough-cheeked girls of that high-wind country
were well enough for cowboys to swing in their wild
dances; just a rung above the squaws on the reservation
in the matter of loquacity and of gum. Hardly
the sort for a man who had the memory of white
gloves and gleaming shoulders, and the traditions of
the service to maintain.</p>
<p>Of course there was the exception of Nola
Chadron, but she was not of Meander and the railroad&rsquo;s
end, and she came only in flashes of summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' ></a>13</span>
brightness, like a swift, gay bird. But when Nola
was at the ranchhouse on the river the gloom lifted
over the post, and the sour leaven in the hearts of
unmarried officers became as sweet as manna in the
cheer of the unusual social outlet thus provided.</p>
<p>Nola kept the big house in a blaze of joy while
she nested there through the summer days. The sixteen
miles which stretched between it and the post
ran out like a silver band before those who rode
into the smile of her welcome, and when she flitted
away to Cheyenne, champagne, and silk hats in the
autumn, a grayness hovered again over the military
post in the corner of the reservation.</p>
<p>Later than usual Nola had lingered on this fall,
and the social outlet had remained open, like a
navigable river over which the threat of ice hung
but had not yet fallen. There were not lacking those
who held that the lodestone which kept her there at
the ranchhouse, when the gaieties of the season beckoned
elsewhere, was in the breast of Major Cuvier
King. Fatal infatuation, said the married ladies at
the post, knowing, as everybody knew in the service,
that Major King was betrothed to Frances Landcraft,
the colonel&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>No matter for any complications which might come
of it, Nola had remained on, and the major had
smiled on her, and ridden with her, and cut high
capers in the dance, all pending the return of
Frances and her mother from their summering at Bar
Harbor in compliance with the family traditions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' ></a>14</span>
Now Frances was back again, and fortune had thrown
a sunburst of beauty into the post by centering her
and Nola here at once. Nola was the guest of the
colonel&rsquo;s daughter, and there were flutterings in
uniformed breasts.</p>
<p>Beef day was an event at the agency which never
grew old to the people at the post. Without beef
day they must have dwindled off to acidulous shadows,
as the Indians who depended upon it for more
solid sustenance would have done in the event of its
discontinuation by a paternal government.</p>
<p>There were phases of Indian life and character
which one never saw save on beef day, which fell on
Wednesday of each week. Guests at the post
watched the bright picture with the keen interest of
a pageant on the stage; tourists came over by stage
from Meander in the summer months by the score to
be present; the resident officers, and their wives and
families&mdash;such as had them&mdash;found in it an ever-recurring
source of interest and relief from the tedium
of days all alike.</p>
<p>This beef day, the morning following the meeting
between Saul Chadron and his mysterious guest, a
chattering group stood on the veranda of Colonel
Landcraft&rsquo;s house in the bright friendly sun. They
were waiting for horses to make the short journey to
the agency&mdash;for one&rsquo;s honesty was questioned, his
sanity doubted, if he went afoot in that country even
a quarter of a mile&mdash;and gayest among them was
Nola Chadron, the sun in her fair, springing hair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' ></a>15</span></div>
<p>Nola&rsquo;s crown reached little higher than a proper
soldier&rsquo;s heart, but what she lacked in stature she
supplied in plastic perfection of body and vivacity
of face. There was a bounding joyousness of life in
her; her eager eyes reflecting only the anticipated
pleasures of today. There was no shadow of yesterday&rsquo;s
regret in them, no cloud of tomorrow&rsquo;s doubt.</p>
<p>On the other balance there was Frances Landcraft,
taller by half a head, soldierly, too, as became her
lineage, in the manner of lifting her chin in what
seemed a patrician scorn of small things such as a
lady should walk the world unconscious of. The
brown in her hair was richer than the clear agate of
her eyes; it rippled across her ear like the scroll of
water upon the sand.</p>
<p>There was a womanly dignity about her, although
the threshold of girlhood must not have been far
behind her that bright autumnal morning. Her nod
was equal to a stave of Nola&rsquo;s chatter, her smile worth
a league of the light laughter from that bounding
little lady&rsquo;s lips. Not that she was always so silent
as on that morning, there among the young wives of
the post, at her own guest&rsquo;s side. She had her hours
of overflowing spirits like any girl, but in some
company she was always grave.</p>
<p>When Major King was in attendance, especially,
the seeing ones made note. And there were others,
too, who said that she was by nature a colonel among
women, haughty, cold and aloof. These wondered
how the major ever had made headway with her up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' ></a>16</span>
the point of gaining her hand. Knowing ones smiled
at that, and said it had been arranged.</p>
<p>There were ambitions on both sides of that match,
it was known&mdash;ambition on the colonel&rsquo;s part to
secure his only child a station of dignity, and what
he held to be of consequence above all achievements
in the world. Major King was a rising man, with
two friends in the cabinet. It was said that he would
be a brigadier-general before he reached forty.</p>
<p>On the major&rsquo;s side, was the ambition to strengthen
his political affiliations by alliance with a family of
patrician strain, together with the money that his
bride would bring, for Colonel Landcraft was a
weighty man in this world&rsquo;s valued accumulations.
So the match had been arranged.</p>
<p>The veranda of the colonel&rsquo;s house gave a view of
the parade grounds and the long avenue that came
down between the officers&rsquo; houses, cottonwoods lacing
their limbs above the road. There was green in the
lawns, the flash of flowers between the leaves and
shrubs, white-gleaming walls, trim walks, shorn
hedges. It seemed a pleasant place of quiet beauty
that bright September morning, and a pity to give it
up by and by to dust and desolation; a place where
men and women might be happy, but for the gnawing
fire of ambition in their hearts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Colonel Landcraft was not going. Indians
made her sick, she said, especially Indians sitting
around in the tall grass waiting for the carcasses to
be cut up and apportioned out to them in bloody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' ></a>17</span>
chunks. But there seemed to be another source of
her sickness that morning, measuring by the grave
glances with which she searched her daughter&rsquo;s face.
She wondered whether the major and Frances had
quarreled; and if so, whether Nola Chadron had been
the cause.</p>
<p>They were off, with the colonel and a lately-assigned
captain in the lead. There was a keener
pleasure in this beef day than usual for the colonel,
for he had new ground to sow with its wonders, which
were beginning to pale in his old eyes which had seen
so much of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely we&rsquo;ll see the minister&rsquo;s wife there,&rdquo;
said he, as they rode forward, &ldquo;and if so, it will be
worth your while to take special note of her. St.
John Mathews, the Episcopalian minister over there
at the mission&mdash;those white buildings there among
the trees&mdash;is a full-blooded Crow. One of the pioneer
missionaries took him up and sent him back East
to school, where in time he entered the ministry and
married this white girl. She was a college girl, I&rsquo;ve
been told, glamoured by the romance of Mathews&rsquo;
life. Well, it was soon over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel sighed, and fell silent. The captain,
feeling that it was intended that he should, made
polite inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that Mathews is an Indian out of
his place,&rdquo; the colonel resumed. &ldquo;He returned here
twenty years or so ago, and took up his work among
his people. But as he advanced toward civilization,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' ></a>18</span>
his wife began to slip back. Little by little she
adopted the Indian ways and dress, until now you
couldn&rsquo;t tell her from a squaw if you were to meet
her for the first time. She presents a curious psychological
study&mdash;or perhaps biological example of
atavism, for I believe there&rsquo;s more body than soul in
the poor creature now. It&rsquo;s nature maintaining the
balance, you see. He goes up; she slips back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s there, she&rsquo;ll be squatting among the
squaws, waiting to carry home her husband&rsquo;s allotment
of warm, bloody beef. She doesn&rsquo;t have to do
it, and it shames and humiliates Mathews, too, even
though they say she cuts it up and divides it among
the poorer Indians. She&rsquo;s a savage; her eyes sparkle
at the sight of red meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rounded the agency buildings and came upon
an open meadow in which the slaughterhouses stood
at a distance from the road. Here, in the grassy
expanse, the Indians were gathered, waiting the distribution
of the meat. The scene was barbarically
animated. Groups of women in their bright dresses
sat here and there on the grass, and apart from them
in gravity waited old men in moccasins and blankets
and with feathers in their hair. Spry young men
smoked cigarettes and talked volubly, garbed in the
worst of civilization and the most useless of savagery.</p>
<p>One and all they turned their backs upon the
visitors, the nearest groups and individuals moving
away from them with the impassive dignity of their
race. There is more scorn in an Indian squaw&rsquo;s back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' ></a>19</span>
turned to an impertinent stranger, than in the faces
of six matrons of society&rsquo;s finest-sifted under similar
conditions.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft led his party across the meadow,
entirely unconscious of the cold disdain of the people
whom he looked down upon from his superior heights.
He could not have understood if any there had felt
the trespass from the Indians&rsquo; side&mdash;and there was
one, very near and dear to the colonel who felt it so&mdash;and
attempted to explain. The colonel very likely
would have puffed up with military consequence
almost to the bursting-point.</p>
<p>Feeling, delicacy, in those smeared, smelling creatures!
Surliness in excess they might have, but
dignity, not at all. Were they not there as beggars
to receive bounty from the government&rsquo;s hand?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Mrs. Mathews!&rdquo; said Nola, with the
eagerness of a child who has found a quail&rsquo;s nest in
the grass. She was off at an angle, like a hunter on
the scent. Colonel Landcraft and his guest followed
with equal rude eagerness, and the others swept after
them, Frances alone hanging back. Major King was
at Nola&rsquo;s side. If he noted the lagging of his fianc&eacute;e
he did not heed.</p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s wife, a shawl over her head, her
braided hair in front of her shoulders like an Indian
woman, rose from her place in startled confusion.
She looked as if she would have fled if an avenue had
been open, or a refuge presented. The embarrassed
creature was obliged to stand in their curious eyes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' ></a>20</span>
and stammer in a tongue which seemed to be growing
strange to her from its uncommon use.</p>
<p>She was a short woman, growing heavy and shapeless
now, and there was gray in her black hair. Her
skin was browned by sun, wind, and smoke to the
hue of her poor neighbors and friends. When she
spoke in reply to the questions which poured upon
her, she bent her head like a timid girl.</p>
<p>Frances checked her horse and remained behind,
out of range of hearing. She was cut to the heart
with shame for her companions, and her cheek burned
with the indignation that she suffered with the harried
woman in their midst. A little Indian girl came
flying past, ducking and dashing under the neck of
Frances&rsquo; horse, in pursuit of a piece of paper which
the wind whirled ahead of her. At Frances&rsquo; stirrup
she caught it, and held it up with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lose this, lady?&rdquo; she asked, in the very
best of mission English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Frances, bending over to see what it
might be. The little girl placed it in her hand and
scurried away again to a beckoning woman, who
stood on her knees and scowled over her offspring&rsquo;s
dash into the ways of civilized little girls.</p>
<p>It was a narrow strip of paper that she had rescued
from the wind, with the names of several men written
on it in pencil, and at the head of the list the name
of Alan Macdonald. Opposite that name some crude
hand had entered, with pen that had flowed heavily
under his pressure, the figures &ldquo;$500.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' ></a>21</span></div>
<p>Frances turned it round her finger and sat waiting
for the others to leave off their persecution of the
minister&rsquo;s wife and come back to her, wondering in
abstracted wandering of mind who Alan Macdonald
might be, and for what purpose he had subscribed
the sum of five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s the most romantic little thing in
the world!&rdquo; Nola was declaring, in her extravagant
surface way as they returned to where Frances sat
her horse, her wandering eyes on the blue foothills,
the strip of paper prominent about her finger. &ldquo;Oh,
honey! what&rsquo;s the matter? Did you cut your
finger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Frances, her serious young face lighting
with a smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a little subscription list, or
something, that somebody lost. Alan Macdonald
heads it for five hundred dollars. Do you know
Alan Macdonald, and what his charitable purpose
may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola tossed her head with a contemptuous sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call him the &lsquo;king of the rustlers&rsquo; up the
river,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he <i>is</i> a man of consequence, then?&rdquo; said
Frances, a quickening of humor in her brown eyes,
seeing that Nola was up on her high horse about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be going down to the slaughter-house
if we want to see the fun,&rdquo; bustled the colonel,
wheeling his horse. &ldquo;I see a movement setting in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a common thief!&rdquo; declared Nola, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' ></a>22</span>
flushed cheek and resentful eye, as Frances fell in
beside her for the march against the abattoir.</p>
<p>Frances still carried the paper twisted about her
finger, reserving her judgment upon Alan Macdonald,
for she knew something of the feuds of that
hard-speaking land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I suppose he&rsquo;d like to have his paper
back,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Will you hand it to him
the next time you meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was entirely grave about it, although it
was only a piece of banter which she felt that Nola
would appreciate. But Nola was not in an appreciative
mood, for she was a full-blooded daughter of the
baronial rule. She jerked her head like a vicious
bronco and reined hurriedly away from Frances as
she extended the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not touch the thing!&rdquo; said Nola, fire in her
eyes.</p>
<p>Major King was enjoying the passage between
the girls, riding at Nola&rsquo;s side with his cavalry hands
held precisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the gentleman in question
is there talking to Miller, the agent,&rdquo; said he, nodding
toward two horsemen a little distance ahead.
&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t excite him, Miss Landcraft, if I
were you. He&rsquo;s said to be the quickest and deadliest
man with a weapon on this range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King smiled over his own pleasantry.
Frances looked at Nola with brows lifted inquiringly,
as if waiting her verification. Then the grave young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' ></a>23</span>
lady settled back in her saddle and laughed merrily,
reaching across and touching her friend&rsquo;s arm in
conciliating caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you delightful little savage!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
believe you&rsquo;d like to take a shot at poor Mr. Macdonald
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never start anything on the reservation,&rdquo;
Nola rejoined, quite seriously.</p>
<p>Miller, the Indian agent, rode away and left Macdonald
sitting there on his horse as the military party
approached. He spurred up to meet the colonel,
and to present his respects to the ladies&mdash;a hard
matter for a little round man with a tight paunch,
sitting in a Mexican saddle. The party halted, and
Frances looked across at Macdonald, who seemed to
be waiting for Miller to rejoin him.</p>
<p>Macdonald was a supple, sinewy man, as he appeared
across the few rods intervening. His coat
was tied with his slicker at the cantle of his saddle,
his blue flannel shirt was powdered with the white
dust of the plain. Instead of the flaring neckerchief
which the cowboys commonly favored, Macdonald
wore a cravat, the ends of it tucked into the bosom
of his shirt, and in place of the leather chaps of
men who ride breakneck through brush and bramble,
his legs were clad in tough brown corduroys, and
fended by boots to his knees. There were revolvers
in the holsters at his belt.</p>
<p>Not an unusual figure for that time and place,
but something uncommon in the air of unbending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' ></a>24</span>
severity that sat on him, which Frances felt even at
that distance. He looked like a man who had a
purpose in his life, and who was living it in his own
brave way. If he was a cattle thief, as charged,
thought she, then she would put her faith against
the world that he was indeed a master of his trade.</p>
<p>They were talking around Miller, who was going
to give them places of vantage for the coming show.
Only Frances and Major King were left behind,
where she had stopped her horse to look curiously
across at Alan Macdonald, king of the rustlers, as
he was called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be anything at all to him, and it may
be something important,&rdquo; said Frances, reaching out
the slip to Major King. &ldquo;Would you mind handing
it to him, and explaining how it came into my
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have anything to do with the fellow!&rdquo;
said the major, flushing hotly. &ldquo;How can you ask
such a thing of <i>me?</i> Throw it away, it&rsquo;s no concern
of yours&mdash;the memorandum of a cattle thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances drew herself straight. Her imperious
chin was as high as Major King ever had carried
his own in the most self-conscious moment of his
military career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take it to him?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; returned the major, haughtily
emphatic. Then, softening a little, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,
Frances; what a row you make over a scrap of blowing
paper!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' ></a>25</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Landcraft!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Major</i> King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the steel of conventionality against the flint
of womanly defiance. Major King started in his
saddle, as if to reach out and restrain her. It was
one of those defiantly foolish little things which
women and men&mdash;especially women&mdash;do in moments
of pique, and Frances knew it at the time. But she
rode away from the major with a hot flush of insubordination
in her cheeks, and Alan Macdonald
quickened from his pensive pose when he saw her
coming.</p>
<p>His hand went to his hat when her intention became
unmistakable to him. She held the little paper out
toward him while still a rod away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little Indian girl gave me this; she found it
blowing along&mdash;they tell me you are Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo;
she said, her face as serious as his own. &ldquo;I
thought it might be a subscription list for a church,
or something, and that you might want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Landcraft,&rdquo; said he, his voice
low-modulated, his manner easy.</p>
<p>Her face colored at the unexpected way of this
man without a coat, who spoke her name with the
accent of refinement, just as if he had known her,
and had met her casually upon the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen you a hundred times at the post and
the agency,&rdquo; he explained, to smooth away her confusion.
&ldquo;I have seen you from afar.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' ></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, as lame as the word was short.</p>
<p>He was scanning the written paper. Now he
looked at her, a smile waking in his eyes. It moved
in slow illumination over his face, but did not break
his lips, pressed in their stern, strong line. She saw
that his long hair was light, and that his eyes were
gray, with sandy brows over them which stood on
end at the points nearest his nose, from a habit of
bending them in concentration, she supposed, as he
had been doing but a moment before he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t a church subscription, Miss Landcraft,
it&rsquo;s for a cemetery,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she again, wondering why she did not
go back to Major King, whose horse appeared
restive, and in need of the spur, which the major
gave him unfeelingly.</p>
<p>At the same time she noted that Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s
forehead was broad and deep, for his leather-weighted
hat was pushed back from it where his fair, straight
hair lay thick, and that his bony chin had a little
croft in it, and that his face was long, and hollowed
like a student&rsquo;s, and that youth was in his eyes in
spite of the experience which hardships of unknown
kind had written across his face. Not a handsome
man, but a strong one in his way, whatever that
way might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indebted to you for this,&rdquo; said he, drawing
forth his watch with a quick movement as he spoke,
opening the back cover, folding the little paper carefully
away in it, &ldquo;and grateful beyond words.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' ></a>27</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo; said she, wheeling
her horse suddenly, smiling back at him as she rode
away to Major King.</p>
<p>Alan Macdonald sat with his hat off until she was
again at the major&rsquo;s side, when he replaced it over
his fair hair with slow hand, as if he had come from
some holy presence. As for Frances, her turn of
defiance had driven her clouds away. She met the
major smiling and radiant, a twinkling of mischief
in her lively eyes.</p>
<p>The major was a diplomat, as all good soldiers,
and some very indifferent ones, are. Whatever his
dignity and gentler feelings had suffered while she
was away, he covered the hurt now with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how fares the bandit king this morning?&rdquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be in spirits,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>The others were out of sight around the buildings
where the carcasses of beef had been prepared. Nobody
but the major knew of Frances&rsquo; little dash out
of the conventional, and the knowledge that it was
so was comfortable in his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the pe-apers,&rdquo; said he, in melodramatic
whisper, &ldquo;were they the thieves&rsquo; muster roll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a thief,&rdquo; said she, with quiet dignity,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s a gentleman. Yes, the paper <i>was</i> important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! the plot deepens!&rdquo; said Major King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a matter of life and death,&rdquo; said she,
with solemn rebuke for his levity, speaking a truer
word than she was aware.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE RANCHHOUSE BY THE RIVER</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Saul Chadron had built himself into that
house. It was a solid and assertive thing of
rude importance where it stood in the great plain,
the river lying flat before it in its low banks like a
gray thread through the summer green. There was
a bold front to the house, and a turret with windows,
standing like a lighthouse above the sea of meadows
in which his thousand-numbered cattle fed.</p>
<p>As white as a dove it sat there among the cottonwoods
at the riverside. A stream of water led into
its gardens to gladden them and give them life. Years
ago, when Chadron&rsquo;s importance was beginning to
feel itself strong upon its legs, and when Nola was
a little thing with light curls blowing about her blue
eyes, the house had grown up under the wand of
riches in that barren place.</p>
<p>The post at Fort Shakie had been the nearest
neighbor in those days, and it remained the nearest
neighbor still, with the exception of one usurper and
outcast homesteader, Alan Macdonald by name, who
had invaded the land over which Chadron laid his
extensive claim. Fifteen miles up the river from
the grand white house Macdonald had strung his
barbed wire and carried in the irrigation ditch to
his alfalfa field. He had chosen the most fertile spot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' ></a>29</span>
in the vast plain through which the river swept, and
it was in the heart of Saul Chadron&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>After the lordly manner of the cattle &ldquo;barons,&rdquo;
as they were called in the Northwest, Chadron set
his bounds by mountains and rivers. Twenty-five
hundred square miles, roughly measured, lay within
his lines, the Alamito Ranch he called it&mdash;the Little
Cottonwood. He had no more title to that great
sweep of land than the next man who might come
along, and he paid no rental fee to nation nor state
for grazing his herds upon it. But the cattle barons
had so apportioned the land between themselves, and
Saul Chadron, and each member of the Drovers&rsquo;
Association, had the power of their mighty organization
to uphold his hand. That power was incontestable
in the Northwest in its day; there was no
higher law.</p>
<p>This Alan Macdonald was an unaccountable man,
a man of education, it was said, which made him
doubly dangerous in Saul Chadron&rsquo;s eyes. Saul himself
had come up from the saddle, and he was not
strong on letters, but he had seen the power of learning
in lawyers&rsquo; offices, and he respected it, and handled
it warily, like a loaded gun.</p>
<p>Chadron had sent his cowboys up the river when
Macdonald first came, and tried to &ldquo;throw a holy
scare into him,&rdquo; as he put it. The old formula did
not work in the case of the lean, long-jawed, bony-chinned
man. He was polite, but obdurate, and his
quick gray eyes seemed to read to their inner process
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' ></a>30</span>
of bluff and bluster as through tissue paper before
a lamp. When they had tried to flash their guns on
him, the climax of their play, he had beaten them to
it. Two of them were carried back to the big ranchhouse
in blankets, with bullets through their fleshy
parts&mdash;not fatal wounds, but effective.</p>
<p>The problem of a fighting &ldquo;nester&rdquo; was a new one
to the cattlemen of that country. For twenty years
they had kept that state under the dominion of the
steer, and held its rich agricultural and mineral lands
undeveloped. The herbage there, curing in the dry
suns of summer as it stood on the upland plains,
provided winter forage for their herds. There was
no need for man to put his hand to the soil and
debase himself to a peasant&rsquo;s level when he might
live in a king&rsquo;s estate by roaming his herds over the
untamed land.</p>
<p>Homesteaders who did not know the conditions
drifted there on the westward-mounting wave, only
to be hustled rudely away, or to pay the penalty of
refusal with their lives. Reasons were not given,
rights were not pleaded by the lords of many herds.
They had the might to work their will; that was
enough.</p>
<p>So it could be understood what indignation
mounted in the breast of tough old Saul Chadron
when a pigmy homesteader put his firm feet down
on the ground and refused to move along at his
command, and even fought back to maintain what he
claimed to be his rights. It was an unprecedented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' ></a>31</span>
stand, a dangerous example. But this nester had
held out for more than two years against his forces,
armed by some invisible strength, it seemed, guarded
against ambuscades and surprises by some cunning
sense which led him whole and secure about his nefarious
ways.</p>
<p>Not alone that, but other homesteaders had come
and settled near him across the river on two other
big ranches which cornered there against Chadron&rsquo;s
own. These nesters drew courage from Macdonald&rsquo;s
example, and cunning from his counsel, and stood
against the warnings, persecutions, and attempts at
forceful dislodgment. The law of might did not seem
to apply to them, and there was no other source equal
to the dignity of the Drovers&rsquo; Association&mdash;at least
none to which it cared to carry its grievances and
air them.</p>
<p>So they cut Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s fences, and other
homesteaders&rsquo; fences, in the night and drove a thousand
or two cattle across his fields, trampling the
growing grain and forage into the earth; they persecuted
him in a score of harassing, quick, and
hidden blows. But this homesteader was not to be
driven away by ordinary means. Nature seemed to
lend a hand to him, he made crops in spite of the
cattlemen, and was prospering. He had taken root
and appeared determined to remain, and the others
were taking deep root with him, and the free, wide
range was coming under the menace of the fence
and the lowly plow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' ></a>32</span></div>
<p>That was the condition of things in those fair
autumn days when Prances Landcraft returned to
the post. The Drovers&rsquo; Association, and especially
the president of it, was being defied in that section,
where probably a hundred homesteaders had settled
with their families of long-backed sons and daughters.
They were but a speck on the land yet, as
Chadron had told the smoky stranger when he had
engaged him to try his hand at throwing the &ldquo;holy
scare.&rdquo; But they spread far over the upland plain,
having sought the most favored spots, and they were
a blight and a pest in the eyes of the cattlemen.</p>
<p>Nola had flitted back to the ranchhouse, carrying
Frances with her to bring down the curtain on her
summer&rsquo;s festivities there in one last burst of joy.
The event was to be a masquerade, and everybody
from the post was coming, together with the few from
Meander who had polish enough to float them, like
new needles in a glass of water, through frontier society&rsquo;s
depths. Some were coming from Cheyenne,
also, and the big house was dressed for them, even
to the bank of palms to conceal the musicians, in
the polite way that society has of standing something
in front of what it cannot well dispense with,
yet of which it appears to be ashamed.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon of the festal day, and Nola
sighed happily as she stood with Frances in the ballroom,
surveying the perfection of every detail.
Money could do things away off there in that corner
of the world as well as it could do them in Omaha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' ></a>33</span>
or elsewhere. Saul Chadron had hothouses in which
even oranges and pineapples grew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was in the living-room, with its big
fireplace and homely things, when they came chattering
out of the enchanted place. She was sitting
by the window which gave her a view of the dim gray
road where it came over the grassy swells from
Meander and the world, knitting a large blue sock.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was a cow-woman of the unimproved
school. She was a heavy feeder on solids, and she
liked plenty of chili peppers in them, which combination
gave her a waist and a ruddiness of face like a
brewer. But she was a good woman in her fashion,
which was narrow, and intolerant of all things which
did not wear hoofs and horns, or live and grow mighty
from the proceeds of them. She never had expanded
mentally to fit the large place that Saul had made
for her in the world of cattle, although her struggle
had been both painful and sincere.</p>
<p>Now she had given it up, and dismissed the troubles
of high life from her fat little head, leaving Nola
to stand in the door and do the honors with credit
to the entire family. She had settled down to her
roasts and hot condiments, her knitting and her afternoon
naps, as contentedly as an old cat with a
singed back under a kitchen stove. She had no
desire to go back to the winter home in Cheyenne,
with its grandeur, its Chinese cook, and furniture
that she was afraid to use. There was no satisfaction
in that place for Mrs. Chadron, beyond the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' ></a>34</span>
swelling pride of ownership. For comfort, peace,
and a mind at ease, give her the ranchhouse by the
river, where she could set her hand to a dish if she
wanted to, no one thinking it amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare! if here don&rsquo;t come Banjo Gibson,&rdquo; said she,
her hand on the curtain, her red face
near the pane like a beacon to welcome the coming
guest. There was pleasure in her voice, and anticipation.
The blue sock slid from her lap to the floor,
forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Banjo,&rdquo; said Nola. &ldquo;I wonder where
he&rsquo;s been all summer? I haven&rsquo;t seen him in an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Frances inquired, looking out at
the approaching figure,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The troubadour of the North Platte, I call him,&rdquo;
laughed Nola; &ldquo;the queerest little traveling musician
in a thousand miles. He belongs back in the days
of romance, when men like him went playing from
castle to court&mdash;the last one of his kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances watched him with new interest as he drew
up to the big gate, which was arranged with weights
and levers so that a horseman could open and close
it without leaving the saddle. The troubadour rode
a mustang the color of a dry chili pepper, but with
none of its spirit. It came in with drooping head,
the reins lying untouched on its neck, its mane and
forelock platted and adorned fantastically with vari-colored
ribbons. Rosettes were on the bridle, a fringe
of leather thongs along the reins.</p>
<p>The musician himself was scarcely less remarkably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' ></a>35</span>
than the horse. He looked at that distance&mdash;now
being at the gate&mdash;to be a dry little man of middle
age, with a thirsty look about his throat, which was
long, with a lump in it like an elbow. He was a
slender man and short, with gloves on his hands, a
slight sandy mustache on his lip, and wearing a dun-colored
hat tilted a little to one side, showing a waviness
almost curly in his glistening black hair. He
carried a violin case behind his saddle, and a banjo
in a green covering slung like a carbine over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know where to put his horse,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chadron, getting up with a new interest in life, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll just go and have Maggie stir him up a bite to
eat and warm the coffee. He&rsquo;s always hungry when
he comes anywhere, poor little man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he play that battery of instruments?&rdquo;
Prances asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you hear him,&rdquo; nodded Nola, a laugh
in her merry eyes.</p>
<p>Then they fell to talking of the coming night,
and of the trivial things which are so much to youth,
and to watching along the road toward Meander for
the expected guests from Cheyenne, who were to come
up on the afternoon train.</p>
<p>Regaled at length, Banjo Gibson, in the wake of
Mrs. Chadron, who presented him with pride, came
into the room where the young ladies waited with
impatience the waning of the daylight hours. Banjo
acknowledged the honor of meeting Miss Landcraft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' ></a>36</span>
with extravagant words, which had the flavor of a
manual of politeness and a ready letter-writer in
them. He was on more natural terms with Nola,
having known her since childhood, and he called her
&ldquo;Miss Nola,&rdquo; and held her hand with a tender lingering.</p>
<p>His voice was full and rich, a deep, soft note in
it like a rare instrument in tune. His small feet
were shod in the shiningest of shoes, which he had
given a furbishing in the barn, and a flowing cravat
tied in a large bow adorned his low collar. There
were stripes in the musician&rsquo;s shirt like a Persian
tent, but it was as clean and unwrinkled as if he had
that moment put it on.</p>
<p>Banjo Gibson&mdash;if he had any other christened
name, it was unknown to men&mdash;was an original. As
Nola had said, he belonged back a few hundred years,
when musical proficiency was not so common as now.
The profession was not crowded in that country,
happily, and Banjo traveled from ranch to ranch
carrying cheer and entertainment with him as he
passed.</p>
<p>He had been doing that for years, having worked
his way westward from Nebraska with the big cattle
ranches, and his art was his living. Banjo&rsquo;s arrival
at a ranch usually resulted in a dance, for which he
supplied the music, and received such compensation
as the generosity of the host might fix. Banjo never
quarreled over such matters. All he needed was
enough to buy cigarettes and shirts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' ></a>37</span></div>
<p>Banjo seldom played in company with any other
musician, owing to certain limitations, which he
raised to distinguishing virtues. He played by &ldquo;air,&rdquo;
as he said, despising the unproficiency of all such as
had need of looking on a book while they fiddled.
Knowing nothing of transposition, he was obliged to
tune his banjo&mdash;on those rare occasions when he
stooped to play &ldquo;second&rdquo; at a dance&mdash;in the key
of each fresh tune. This was hard on the strings, as
well as on the patience of the player, and Banjo liked
best to go it single-handed and alone.</p>
<p>When he heard that musicians were coming from
Cheyenne&mdash;a day&rsquo;s journey by train&mdash;to play for
Nola&rsquo;s ball, his face told that he was hurt, but his
respect of hospitality curbed his words. He knew
that there was one appreciative ear in the mansion
by the river that no amount of &ldquo;dago fiddlin&rsquo;&rdquo; ever
would charm and satisfy like his own voice with the
banjo, or his little brown fiddle when it gave out the
old foot-warming tunes. Mrs. Chadron was his
champion in all company, and his friend in all places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sakes alive! Banjo, I&rsquo;m as tickled to see
you as if you was one of my own folks,&rdquo; she declared,
her face as warm as if she had just gorged on the
hottest of hot dishes which her Mexican cook, Maggie,
could devise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be able to make it around ag&rsquo;in, thank
you, mom,&rdquo; Banjo assured her, sentiment and soul
behind the simple words. &ldquo;I always carry a warm
place in my heart for Alamito wherever I may stray.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' ></a>38</span></div>
<p>Nola frisked around and took the banjo from its
green cover, talking all the time, pushing and placing
chairs, and settling Banjo in a comfortable place.
Then she armed him with the instrument, making
quite a ceremony of it, and asked him to play.</p>
<p>Banjo twanged the instrument into tune, hooked
the toe of his left foot behind the forward leg of his
chair, and struck up a song which he judged would
please the young ladies. Of Mrs. Chadron he was
sure; she had laughed over it a hundred times. It
was about an adventure which the bard had shared
with his gal in a place designated in Banjo&rsquo;s uncertain
vocabulary as &ldquo;the big cook-quari-um.&rdquo; It
began:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh-h-h, I stopped at a big cook-quari-um</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Not very long ago,</p>
<p>To see the bass and suckers</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And hear the white whale blow.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>The chorus of it ran:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh-h-h-h, the big sea-line he howled and he growled,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>The seal beat time on a drum;</p>
<p>The whale he swallered a den-vereel</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>In the big cook-quari-um.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>From that one Banjo passed to &ldquo;The Cowboy&rsquo;s
Lament,&rdquo; and from tragedy to love. There could be
nothing more moving&mdash;if not in one direction, then
in another&mdash;than the sentimental expression of
Banjo&rsquo;s little sandy face as he sang:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' ></a>39</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>I know you were once my true-lov-o-o-o,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>But such a thing it has an aind;</p>
<p>My love and my transpo&rsquo;ts are ov-o-o-o,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>But you may still be my fraind-d-d.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>Sundown was rosy behind the distant mountains,
a sea of purple shadows laved their nearer feet, when
Banjo got out his fiddle at Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s request
and sang her &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; along with the moving tones
of that instrument.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Dau-ling I am growing-a o-o-eld,</p>
<p>Seel-vo threads a-mong tho go-o-ld&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>As he sang, Nola slipped from the room. He was
finishing when she sped by the window and came
sparkling into the room with the announcement that
the guests from far Cheyenne were coming. Frances
was up in excitement; Mrs. Chadron searched the
floor for her unfinished sock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that flashed a-past the winder like a
streak a minute ago?&rdquo; Banjo inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flashed by the window?&rdquo; Nola repeated, puzzled.</p>
<p>Frances laughed, the two girls stopping in the
door, merriment gleaming from their young faces like
rays from iridescent gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that was Nola,&rdquo; Frances told him, curious
to learn what the sentimental eyes of the little musician
foretold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a star from the sky,&rdquo; said
Banjo, sighing softly, like a falling leaf.</p>
<p>As they waited at the gate to welcome the guests,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' ></a>40</span>
who were cantering up with a curtain of dust behind
them, they laughed over Banjo&rsquo;s compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something behind those eyes,&rdquo;
said Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No telling how long he&rsquo;s been saving it for a
chance to work it off on somebody,&rdquo; Nola said. &ldquo;He
got it out of a book&mdash;the Mexicans all have them,
full of <i>brindies</i>, what we call toasts, and silly soft
compliments like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them, little red books that they give
for premiums with the Mexican papers down in
Texas,&rdquo; Frances nodded, &ldquo;but Banjo didn&rsquo;t get that
out of a book&mdash;it was spontaneous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must write it down, and compare it with the
next time he gets it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him credit for the way he delivered it, no
matter where he got it,&rdquo; Frances laughed. &ldquo;Many
a more sophisticated man than your desert troubadour
would have broken his neck over that. He&rsquo;s
in love with you, Nola&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you hear him sigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has been ever since I was old enough to
take notice of it,&rdquo; returned Nola, lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my luv&rsquo;s like a falling star,&rdquo; paraphrased
Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; Nola denied, more than half serious.
&ldquo;Venus is ascendant; you keep your eye on her and
see.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE MAN IN THE PLAID</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>There was no mistaking the assiduity with
which Major King waited upon Nola Chadron
that night at the ball, any more than there was a
chance for doubt of that lively little lady&rsquo;s identity.
He sought her at the first, and hung by her side
through many dances, and promenaded her in the
garden walks where Japanese lanterns glimmered
dimly in the soft September night, with all the close
attention of a farrier cooling a valuable horse.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was punishment&mdash;or meant to be&mdash;for
the insubordination of Frances Landcraft in
speaking to the outlawed Alan Macdonald on last
beef day. If so, it was systematically and faithfully
administered.</p>
<p>Nola was dressed like a cowgirl. Not that there
were any cowgirls in that part of the country, or
anywhere else, who dressed that way, except at the
Pioneer Week celebration at Cheyenne, and in the
romantic dramas of the West. But she was so
attired, perhaps for the advantage the short skirt
gave her handsome ankles&mdash;and something in silk
stockings which approached them in tapering grace.</p>
<p>She was improving her hour, whether out of exuberant
mischief or in deadly earnest the ladies from
the post were puzzled to understand, and if headway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' ></a>42</span>
toward the already pledged heart of Major King
was any indication of it, her star was indeed ascendant.</p>
<p>Frances Landcraft appeared at the ball as an
Arabian lady, meaning in her own interpretation of
the masking to stand as a representation of the
&ldquo;Thou,&rdquo; who is endearingly and importantly capitalized
in the verses of the ancient singer made famous
by Irish-English Fitzgerald. Her disguise was sufficient,
only that her hair was so richly assertive.
There was not any like it in the cattle country; very
little like it anywhere. It was a telltale, precious
possession, and Major King never could have made
good a plea of hidden identity against it in this
world.</p>
<p>Frances had consolation enough for his alienation
and absence from her side if numbers could compensate
for the withdrawal of the fealty of one. She
distributed her favors with such judicial fairness that
the tongue of gossip could not find a breach. At
least until the tall Scotsman appeared, with his defiant
red hair and a feather in his bonnet, his plaid
fastened across his shoulder with a golden clasp.</p>
<p>Nobody knew when he arrived, or whence. He
spoke to none as he walked in grave stateliness among
the merry groups, acknowledging bold challenges and
gay banterings only with a bow. The ladies from
the post had their guesses as to who he might be,
and laid cunning little traps to provoke him into betrayal
through his voice. As cunningly he evaded</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' ></a>43</span></div>
<p>them, with unsmiling courtesy, his steady gray eyes
only seeming to laugh at them behind his green
mask.</p>
<p>Frances had finished a dance with a Robin Hood&mdash;the
slender one in billiard-cloth green&mdash;there being
no fewer than four of them, variously rounded, diversely
clad, when the Scot approached her where
she stood with her gallant near the musicians&rsquo; brake
of palms.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>A flask of wine, a book of verse&mdash;and Thou</p>
<p>Beside me singing in the wilderness&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>said the tall Highlandman, bending over her shoulder,
his words low in her ear. &ldquo;Only I could be
happy without the wine,&rdquo; he added, as she faced him
in quick surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your penetration deserves a reward&mdash;you are
the first to guess it,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three dances, no less,&rdquo; said he, like a usurer
demanding his toll.</p>
<p>He offered his arm, and straightway bore her off
from the astonished Robin Hood, who stood staring
after them, believing, perhaps, that he was the victim
of some prearranged plan.</p>
<p>The spirit of his free ancestors seemed to be in
the lithe, tall Highlander&rsquo;s feet. There was no dancer
equal to him in that room. A thistle on the wind
was not lighter, nor a wheeling swallow more graceful
in its flight.</p>
<p>Many others stopped their dancing to watch that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' ></a>44</span>
pair; whisperings ran round like electrical conjectures.
Nola steered Major King near the whirling
couple, and even tried to maneuver a collision, which
failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that dancing with Frances Landcraft?&rdquo;
she breathed in the major&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was Miss Landcraft,&rdquo; he replied,
although he knew it very well, and resolved to find
out who the Scotsman was, speedily and completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My enchanted hour will soon pass,&rdquo; said the
Scot, when that dance was done, &ldquo;and I have been
looking the world over for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing all the way?&rdquo; she asked him lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; he answered, his voice still muffled
and low.</p>
<p>They were standing withdrawn a little from the
press in the room after their second dance, when
Major King came by. The major was a cavalier
in drooping hat, with white satin cape, and sword
by his side, and well enough known to all his friends
in spite of the little spat of mustache and beard. As
the major passed he jostled the Scot with his shoulder
with a rudeness openly intentional.</p>
<p>The major turned, and spoke an apology. Frances
felt the Highlander&rsquo;s muscles swell suddenly where
her hand lay on his arm, but whatever had sprung
into his mind he repressed, and acknowledged the
major&rsquo;s apology with a lofty nod.</p>
<p>The music for another dance was beginning, and
couples were whirling out upon the floor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' ></a>45</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to dance again just now, delightfully
as you carry a clumsy one like me through&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A self-disparagement, even, can&rsquo;t stand unchallenged,&rdquo;
he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;your wig is
awry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were near the door opening to the illumined
garden, with its late roses, now at their best, and
hydrangea clumps plumed in foggy bloom. They
stepped out of the swirl of the dance like particles
thrown from a wheel, not missed that moment even
by those interested in keeping them in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew me!&rdquo; said he, triumphantly glad, as
they entered the garden&rsquo;s comparative gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the first word,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here in the hope that you would know
me, and you alone&mdash;I came with my heart full of
that hope, and you knew me at the first word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not so much marvel as satisfaction, even
pride for her penetration, in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody else may have recognized you, too&mdash;that
man who brushed against you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of your officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;Major King. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and he doesn&rsquo;t know me. He can have no interest
in me at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; set your beautiful red wig straight
and then tell me why you wanted to come here among
your enemies. It seems to me a hardy challenge, a
most unnecessary risk.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' ></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No risk is unnecessary that brings me to you,&rdquo;
he said, his voice trembling in earnestness. &ldquo;I dared
to come because I hoped to meet you on equal
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bold man&mdash;in more ways than one.&rdquo;
She shook her head as in rebuke of his temerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m a thief,&rdquo; said he, conclusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I have made public denial of it.&rdquo; She
laughed lightly, but a little nervously, an uneasiness
over her that she could not define.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An angel has risen to plead for Alan Macdonald,
then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you need anybody to plead for you
if there&rsquo;s no truth in their charges? What is a man
like you doing in this wild place, wasting his life in
a land where he isn&rsquo;t wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had turned into a path that branched beyond
the lanterns. The white gravel from the river bars
with which it was paved glimmered among the
shadowy shrubs. Macdonald unclasped his plaid
from his shoulders and transferred it to hers. She
drew it round her, wrapping her arms in it like a
squaw, for the wind was coming chill from the mountains
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is soon said,&rdquo; he answered, quite willingly.
&ldquo;I am not hiding under any other man&rsquo;s name&mdash;the
one they call me by here is my own. I was a &lsquo;son of
a family,&rsquo; as they say in Mexico, and looked for distinction,
if not glory, in the diplomatic service. Four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' ></a>47</span>
years I grubbed, an under secretary in the legation
at Mexico City, then served three more as consul at
Valparaiso. An engineer who helped put the railroad
through this country told me about it down there
when the rust of my inactive life was beginning to
canker my body and brain. I threw up my chance for
diplomatic distinction and came off up here looking
for life and adventure, and maybe a copper mine. I
didn&rsquo;t find the mine, but I&rsquo;ve had some fun with the
other two. Sometimes I&rsquo;d like to lose the adventure
part of it now&mdash;it gets tiresome to be hunted, after
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo; she asked, after a little, seeing that
he walked slowly, his head up, his eyes far away on
the purple distances of the night, as if he read a
dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I settled in this valley quite innocently, as others
have done, before and after me, not knowing conditions.
You&rsquo;ve heard it said that I&rsquo;m a rustler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King of the rustlers,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even that. But I am not a rustler. Everybody
up here is a rustler, Miss Landcraft, who
doesn&rsquo;t belong to, or work for, the Drovers&rsquo; Association.
They can&rsquo;t oust us by merely charging us
with homesteading government land, for that hasn&rsquo;t
been made a statutory crime yet. They have to
make some sort of a charge against us to give the
color of justification to the crimes they practice on
us, and rustler is the worst one in the cattlemen&rsquo;s
dictionary. It stands ahead of murder and arson in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' ></a>48</span>
this country. I&rsquo;m not saying there are no rustlers
around the edges of these big ranches, for there are
some. But if there are any among the settlers up
our way we don&rsquo;t know it&mdash;and I think we&rsquo;d pretty
soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and walked back toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should trouble about it; this
plainly isn&rsquo;t your place,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I refused to be driven out by Chadron
and the rest because the thing got on my mettle. I
knew that I was right, and that they were simply
stealing the public domain. Then, as I hung on, it
became apparent that there was a man&rsquo;s work cut
out for somebody up here. I&rsquo;ve taken the ready-made
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a monstrous injustice being practiced,
systematically and cruelly, against thousands of
homeless people who come to this country in innocent
hope every year. They come here believing it&rsquo;s the
great big open-handed West they&rsquo;ve heard so much
about, carrying everything with them that they
own. They cut the strings that hold them to the
things they know when they face this way, and when
they try to settle on the land that is their inheritance,
this copper-bottomed combination of stockmen drives
them out. If they don&rsquo;t go, they shoot them. You&rsquo;ve
heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just that way,&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they never shoot anybody but a rustler, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' ></a>49</span>
way the world hears of it,&rdquo; said he, in resentment.
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll hear another story on the outside one
of these days. I&rsquo;m in this fight up to the eyes to
break the back of this infernal combination that&rsquo;s
choking this state to death. It&rsquo;s the first time in
my life that I ever laid my hand to anything for
anybody but myself, and I&rsquo;m going to see it through
to daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be millions behind the cattlemen,
Mr. Macdonald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are. It seems just about hopeless that a
handful of ragged homesteaders ever can make a
stand against them. But they&rsquo;re usurping the public
domain, and they&rsquo;ll overreach themselves one of these
days. Chadron has title to this homestead, but that&rsquo;s
every inch of land that he&rsquo;s got a legal right over.
In spite of that, he lays the claim of ownership to
the land fifteen miles north of here, where I&rsquo;ve nested.
He&rsquo;s been telling me for more than two years that I
must clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could give it up, and go back to your work
among men, where it would count,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are things here that count. I couldn&rsquo;t put
a state on the map&mdash;an industrial and progressive
one, I mean&mdash;back home in Washington, or sitting
with my feet on the desk in some sleepy consulate.
And I&rsquo;m going to put this state on the map where it
belongs. That&rsquo;s the job that&rsquo;s cut out for me here,
Miss Landcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it without boast, but with such a stubborn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' ></a>50</span>
note of determination that she felt something lift
within her, raising her to the plane of his aspirations.
She knew that Alan Macdonald was right about it,
although the thing that he would do was still dim in
her perception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then, I don&rsquo;t see what a ranch away off up
here from anywhere ever will be worth to you, especially
when the post is abandoned. You know the
department is going to give it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you&mdash;&rdquo; he began in consternation,
checking himself to add, slowly, &ldquo;no, I didn&rsquo;t know
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps in a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t make much difference in the value of
land up this valley, though,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;When the
railroad comes on through&mdash;and that will be as soon
as we break the strangle hold of Chadron and men
like him&mdash;this country will develop overnight.
There&rsquo;s petroleum under the land up where I am,
lying shallow, too. That will be worth something
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music of an old-style dance was being played.
Now the piping cowboy voice of some range cavalier
rose, calling the figures. The two in the garden path
turned with one accord and faced away from the
bright windows again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be unmasking at midnight?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t go in again, then. The hour
of my enchantment is nearly at its end.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' ></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have come,&rdquo; she chided, yet not
in severity, rather in subdued admiration for his reckless
bravery. &ldquo;Suppose they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac! O Mac!&rdquo; called a cautious, low voice from
a hydrangea bush close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; demanded Macdonald, springing
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re onto you, Mac,&rdquo; answered the voice from
the shrub, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do you hurt. They&rsquo;re
lookin&rsquo; for you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little rustling in the leaves as the
unseen friend moved away. The voice was the voice
of Banjo Gibson, but not even the shadow of the
messenger had been seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have gone before&mdash;hurry!&rdquo; she
whispered in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. It was a risk, and I took it, and
I&rsquo;d take it again tomorrow. It gave me these minutes
with you, it was worth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go! Where&rsquo;s your horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the river in the willows. I can get to
him, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may come any minute, they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re dancing yet. I expected they&rsquo;d find
me out; they know me too well. I&rsquo;ll get a start of
them, before they even know I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be waiting farther on&mdash;why don&rsquo;t
you go&mdash;go! There&mdash;listen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saddling,&rdquo; he whispered, as low sounds
of haste came from the barnyard corral.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' ></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go&mdash;quick!&rdquo; she urged, flinging his plaid across
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going&mdash;in one moment more. Miss Landcraft,
I&rsquo;ll ride away from you tonight perhaps never
to see you again, and if I speak impetuously before
I leave you, forgive me before you hear the words&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
not hurt you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll shame
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything more, Mr. Macdonald&mdash;even
this delay may cost your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill me if they can; they&rsquo;ve tried it more
than once. I never know when I ride away whether
I&rsquo;ll ever return. It isn&rsquo;t a new experience, just a
little graver than usual&mdash;only that. I came here
tonight because I&mdash;I came to&mdash;in the hope&mdash;&rdquo; he
stammered, putting out his hands as if supplicating
her to understand, his plaid falling to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she whispered, her hand on his arm in
appeal, standing near him, dangerously near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a right to love you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a right!&rdquo;
he said, the torrent of his passion leaping all curbing
obstacles of delicacy, confusion, fear. He flung the
words from him in wild vehemence, as if they eased
a pang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, you have no right! you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you in a minute, Frances, without the
expectation of ever seeing you again&mdash;only with the
hope. It&rsquo;s mine to love you, mine to have you if I
come through this night. If you&rsquo;re pledged to another
man it can&rsquo;t be because you love him, and I&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' ></a>53</span>
tear the right away from him&mdash;if I come through
this night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke rapidly, bending so near that his breath
moved the hair on her temple. She stood with arms
half lifted, her hands clenched, her breath laboring
in her bosom. She did not know that love&mdash;she had
not known that love&mdash;could spring up that way, and
rage like a flame before a wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re pledged to another man, then I&rsquo;ll defy
him, man to man&mdash;I do defy him, I challenge him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he stooped, suddenly, like a wind-bent
flame, clasped her, kissed her, held her enfolded in
his arms one moment against his breast. He released
her then, and stepped back, standing tall and
silent, as if he waited for her blast of scorn. It did
not come. She was standing with hands pressed to
her face, as if to cover some shame or sorrow, or
ease the throbbing of a soul-deep pain.</p>
<p>The sound of men and horses came from the corral.
He stood, waiting for judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go now,&rdquo; she said, in a sad, small voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a token to carry away, to tell me I have
not broken my golden hope,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll give you nothing!&rdquo; she declared, with
the sharpness of one wronged, and helpless of redress.
&ldquo;You have taken too much&mdash;you have taken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked, as if he exulted in what he
heard, his blood singing in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go&mdash;go!&rdquo; she moaned, stripping off one
long white glove and throwing it to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' ></a>54</span></div>
<p>He caught it, and pressed it to his lips; then
snatching off his bonnet, hid it there, and bent among
the shrubbery and was gone, as swiftly and silently
as a wolf. Frances flew to the house and up the
stairs to her room. There she threw up the window
and sat panting in it, straining, listening, for sounds
from the river road.</p>
<p>From below the voices of the revelers came, and
the laughter over the secrets half-guessed before
masks were snatched away around the banquet table.
There was a dash of galloping hoofs from the corral,
the clatter of the closing gate. The sound grew
dimmer, was lost, in the sand of the hoof-cut trail.</p>
<p>After a little, a shot! two! a silence; three! and
one as if in reply. Frances slipped to her knees beside
the open window, a sob as bitter as the pang of
death rising from her breast. She prayed that Alan
Macdonald might ride fast, and that the vindictive
hands of his enemies might be unsteady that night by
the gray riverside.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>IF HE WAS A GENTLEMAN</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better drop it now,
Frances, and be good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King reined his horse near hers as he spoke,
and laid his hand on the pommel of her saddle as if
he expected to meet other fingers there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You puzzle me, Major King,&rdquo; she returned, not
willing to understand.</p>
<p>They were bringing up the rear of the tired procession
which was returning to the post from the
ball. Already the east was quickening. The stars
near the horizon were growing pale; the morning
wind was moving, with a warmth in it from the low
places, like a tide toward the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean this play acting of estrangement,&rdquo;
said he, impatiently. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget it&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t
carry naturally with either you or me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Major King!&rdquo; Her voice was lively with
mild surprise; she was looking at him as if for verification
of his words. Then, slowly: &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
thought of any estrangement, I hadn&rsquo;t intended to
bring you to task for one flirtatious night. Be sure,
sir, if it has given you pleasure, it has brought me
no pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You began it,&rdquo; said he, petulantly. It is almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' ></a>56</span>
unbelievable how boyishly silly a full-grown man
can be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began it, Major King? It&rsquo;s too early in the
morning for a joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wilful and contrary; you would speak
to the fellow that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind it, though. Wilfulness doesn&rsquo;t become
either of us, Frances. I&rsquo;ve tried my turn at it
tonight, and it has left me cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; said she, in low voice, like a sigh.
Perhaps it was not all for Major King; perhaps not
all assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not quarrel, Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, I&rsquo;m too tired for a real good one.
Leave it for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode on in silence, not sure, maybe, how much
of it she meant. Covertly she looked at him now and
then, thinking better of him for his ingenuous confession
of failure to warm himself at little Nola
Chadron&rsquo;s heart-flame. She extended her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Major King,&rdquo; she said, very softly,
not far removed, indeed, from tenderness.</p>
<p>For a little while Major King left his horse to
keep the road its own way, his cavalry hands quite
regardless of manuals, regulations, and military airs.
Both of them were enfolding her one. He might
have held it until they reached the post, but that
she drew it away.</p>
<p>There were some qualms of uneasiness in her breast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' ></a>57</span>
that hour, some upbraidings of conscience for treason
to Major King, of whom she had been girlishly fond,
girlishly proud, womanly selfish. That quick, wild
scene in the garden was not to be put away for all
those arraignments of her honest heart, although it
seemed impossible, recalled there in the thin hours
of that long and eventful night, like something remembered
of another, not of herself.</p>
<p>Her cheeks grew hot, her heart leaped again, at
the recollection of that strong man&rsquo;s wild, bold words,
his defiant kiss upon her lips. She had yielded them
in the recklessness of that moment, in the force of
his all-carrying demand, when she might have denied
them, or sped away from him, as innocence is believed
to know from instinct when to fly from a destructive
lure.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes against the gray-creeping morning,
she saw him again, standing that moment with
her glove to his lips; saw him bend and speed away,
the cunning of his hunted ancestors in his swift feet
and self-eliminating form. A wild fear struck her, a
cold dread fell like ashes into her heart, as she wondered
how well he had ridden that night, and how
far.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was lying in his blood that hour, never
to come back to her again. Yet, why should it
matter so much to her? Only that it was a gallant
life gone out, whatever its faults had been; only the
interest that she might have in any man who had
danced with her, and told her his story, and spoken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' ></a>58</span>
of his designs. So she said, confessing with the same
breath that it was a poor, self-deluding lie.</p>
<p>Back again in her home at the post, the day awake
around her, reveille sounding in the barracks, she
turned the key in her door as if to shut the secret in
with her, and bent beneath the strain of her long
suspense. She no longer tried to conceal, or to
deny to her own heart, the love she bore that man,
which had come so suddenly, and so fiercely sweet.</p>
<p>No longer past than the evening before her heart
had ached with jealous pain over the little triumph
that Nola Chadron had thought she was making of
Major King. Now Nola might have Major King,
and all the world beside that her little head might
covet. There was no reservation in the surrender
that she made of him in her conscience, no regret.</p>
<p>She reproached herself for it in one breath, and
glowed with a strange new gladness the next, clasping
the great secret fearfully in her breast, in the
world-old delusion that she had come into possession
of a treasure uniquely and singularly her own. One
thing she understood plainly now; she never had
loved Major King. What a revolution it was to
overturn a life&rsquo;s plans thus in a single night! thought
she.</p>
<p>How easily we are astounded by the eruptions in
our own affairs, and how disciplined in the end to find
that the foundations of the world have withstood the
shock!</p>
<p>Chadron himself had not gone out after Macdonald.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' ></a>59</span>
He had been merry among his guests long after
the shots had sounded up the river. Frances believed
that the old man had put the matter into the
hands of his cowboys and ranch foreman, having no
sons, no near male relatives of his own in that place.
She did not know how many had gone in pursuit of
Macdonald, but several horses were in the party
which rode out of the gate. None had returned, she
was certain, at the time the party dispersed. The
chase must have led them far.</p>
<p>There was no way of knowing what the result of
that race had been. If he had escaped, Frances
believed that he would let her know in some way;
if he had fallen, she knew that the news of his death,
important as it would be to Chadron, would fly
as if it had wings. There was nothing to do but
wait, and in any event hide away that warm sweet
thing that had unfolded in beautiful florescence in
her soul.</p>
<p>She told herself that he must have escaped, or the
pursuers would have returned long before the party
from the post left the Chadron house. He had led
them a long ride in his daring way, and doubtless
was laughing at them now in his own house, among
his friends. She wondered what his surroundings
were, and what his life was like on that ranch for
which he risked it. In the midst of this speculation
she fell asleep, and lay wearily in dreamless repose
for many hours.</p>
<p>Sleep is a marvelous clarifier of the mind. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' ></a>60</span>
like the saleratus which the pioneers used to cast into
their barrels of Missouri River water, to precipitate
the silt and make it clear. Frances rose out of her
sleep with readjusted reasoning; in fear, and in
doubt.</p>
<p>She was shocked by the surrender that she had
made to that unknown man. Perhaps he was nothing
more than a thief, as charged, and this story
fixing his identification had been only a fabrication.
An honest man would have had no necessity for such
haste, such wild insistence of his right to love her.
It seemed, in the light of due reflection, the rude way
of an outlawed hand.</p>
<p>Then there came the soft pleading of something
deeper to answer for Alan Macdonald, and to justify
his rash deed. He had risked life to see her and set
himself right in her eyes, and he had doubled the
risk in standing there in the garden, defiantly proud,
unbent, and unrepentant, refusing to leave her without
some favor to carry away.</p>
<p>There was only a sigh to answer it, after all; only
a hope that time would bring her neither shame nor
regret for that romantic passage in the dusky garden
path. That she had neither shame nor regret in
that hour was her sweetest consolation. More, she
was comfortable in the security that the secret of
that swift interlude was her own. Honest man or
thief, Alan Macdonald was not the man to speak
of that.</p>
<p>Frances was surprised to find that she had slept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' ></a>61</span>
into the middle of the afternoon. Major King had
called an hour ago, with inquiries, the maid reported.
There! that must be the major&rsquo;s ring again&mdash;she
hoped she might know it by this time, indeed. In
case it was the major, would miss&mdash;</p>
<p>Yes; miss would see him. Ask him to wait. The
maid&rsquo;s ear was true; it was the major&rsquo;s ring. She
came bounding upstairs to report on it, her breath
short, her eyes big.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, miss! I think something must &rsquo;a&rsquo; happened
to him, he looks all shook!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Frances, a little flutter of apprehension,
indefinable, cold, passing through her
nerves in spite of her bearing and calm face.</p>
<p>Major King had remained standing, waiting her.
He was handsome and trim in his uniform, dark-eyed,
healthy-skinned, full of the vigor of his young manhood.
The major&rsquo;s face was pale, his carriage stiff
and severe. He appeared as if something might have
happened to him, indeed, or to somebody in whom
he was deeply concerned.</p>
<p>Frances knew that her face was a picture of the
worriment and straining of her past night, for it was
a treacherous mirror of her soul. She smiled as she
made a little pause in the reception-room door.
Major King bowed, with formal, almost official,
dignity. His hand was in the bosom of his coat,
and he drew it forth with something white in it as she
approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully indolent to belong to a soldiering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' ></a>62</span>
family, Major King,&rdquo; she said, offering her hand in
greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; said he, placing the folded white
thing in her outstretched fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Not&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered,
something deeper than surprise, than foreboding, in
her eyes and colorless cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unmistakably yours,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your name is
stamped in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; she owned, her spirits sinking low,
her breath weak between her lips. &ldquo;Thank you,
Major King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glove was soiled with earth-marks; it was
wrinkled and drawn, as if it had come back to her
through conflict and tragedy. She rolled it deliberately,
in a compact little wad, her fingers as cold as
her hope for the life of the man who had borne it
away. She knew that Major King was waiting for a
word; she was conscious of his stern eyes upon her
face. But she did not speak. As far as Major
King&rsquo;s part in it went, the matter was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Landcraft, I am waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King spoke with imperious suggestion.
She started, and looked toward him quickly, a question
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t keep you then,&rdquo; she returned, her words
little more than a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to read a misunderstanding into my
words,&rdquo; said he, his voice shaking. Then he seemed
to break his stiff, controlled pose as if it had been

a coating of ice, and expand into a trembling, white-hot
man in a moment. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s name, girl! Say something,
say something! You know where that glove
was found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and I shall not ask you, Major King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I demand of you to know how it came in that
man&rsquo;s possession! Tell me that&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood before her, very near to her. His hands
were shaking, his eyes gleaming with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might ask you with as much reason how it
came in yours,&rdquo; she told him, resentful of his angry
demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger arrived with it an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, Major King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no need to ask him whence the messenger
came. She could see the horsemen returning to the
ranchhouse by the river in the gray morning light,
in the triumph of their successful hunt. Alan Macdonald
had fallen. It had been Nola&rsquo;s hand that had
dispatched this evidence of what she could but guess
to be the disloyalty of Frances to her betrothed.
If Nola had hoped to make a case with the major,
Frances felt she had succeeded better than she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is nothing more to be said, Major
King,&rdquo; said she, after a little wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much more,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Tell me
that he snatched the glove from you, tell me that
you lost it&mdash;tell me anything, and I&rsquo;ll believe you&mdash;but
tell me something!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' ></a>64</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to tell you,&rdquo; said she, resentful
of the meddling of Nola Chadron, which his own
light conduct with her had in a manner justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can only imagine the truth,&rdquo; he told her,
bitterly. &ldquo;But surely you didn&rsquo;t give him the glove,
surely you cannot love that wolf of the range, that
cattle thief, that murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to ask me that,&rdquo; she said,
flashing with resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a right to ask you that, to ask you more;
not only to ask, but to demand. And you must
answer. You forget that you are my affianced wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not my confessor, for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; groaned King, his teeth set, his
eyes staring as if he had gone mad. &ldquo;Will you shame
us both? Do you forget you are <i>my affianced wife?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is ended&mdash;you are free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances!&rdquo; he cried, sharply, as in despair of one
sinking, whom he was powerless to save.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at an end between us, Major King. My
&lsquo;necessity&rsquo; of explaining everything, or anything, to
you is wiped away, your responsibility for my acts
relieved. Lift your head, sir. You need not blush
before the world for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweat was springing on the major&rsquo;s forehead; he
drew his breath through open lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to humor your caprice&mdash;you are irresponsible,
you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;You are forcing the issue to this point,
Frances, I haven&rsquo;t demanded this.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' ></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You have demanded too much. You may go
now, Major King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the infatuation of a moment. You can&rsquo;t
care for a man like that, Frances,&rdquo; he argued, shaken
out of his passion by her determined stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a matter for discussion between you
and me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King bowed his head as if the rebuke had
crushed him. She stood aside to let him pass. When
he reached the door she turned to him. He paused,
expectantly, hopefully, as if he felt that a reconciliation
was dawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you they wouldn&rsquo;t have
discovered him last night,&rdquo; she charged. &ldquo;You betrayed
him to his enemies. Can you tell me, then&mdash;will
you tell me&mdash;is Alan Macdonald&mdash;dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King stood, his stern eyes on the glove,
unrolled again, now dangling in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he was a gentleman, as you said of him once,
then he is dead,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>He turned and left her. She did not look after
him, but stood with the soiled glove spread in her
hands, gazing upon it in sad tenderness.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>A BOLD CIVILIAN</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Colonel Landcraft was a slight man, and
short of stature for a soldierly figure when out
of the saddle. His gray hair was thinning in front,
and his sharp querulous face was seamed in frowning
pattern about the eyes. His forehead was
fashioned on an intention of massiveness out of
keeping with his tapering face, which ran out in a
disappointing chin, and under the shadow of that
projecting brow his cold blue eyes seemed as unfriendly
as a winter sky.</p>
<p>Early in his soldiering days the colonel had felt
the want of inches and pounds, a shortage which he
tried to overcome by carrying himself pulled up stiffly,
giving him a strutting effect that had fastened upon
him and become inseparable from his mien. This air
of superior brusqueness was sharpened by the small
fierceness of his visage, in which his large iron-gray
mustache branched like horns.</p>
<p>Smallness of stature, disappointment in his ambition
for preferment, and a natural narrowness of soul,
had turned Colonel Landcraft into a military martinet
of the most pronounced character. He was the
grandfather of colonels in the service, rank won in
the old Indian days. That he was not a brigadier-general
was a circumstance puzzling only to himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' ></a>67</span>
He was a man of small bickerings, exactions, forms.
He fussed with civilians as a regular thing when in
command of posts within the precincts of civilization,
and to serve under him, as officer or man, was a chafing
and galling experience.</p>
<p>If ever there was an unpopular man in the service,
then that man was Colonel John Hancock Landcraft,
direct descendant&mdash;he could figure it out as straight
as a bayonet&mdash;of the heavy-handed signer himself.
His years and his empty desires bore heavily on the
colonel. The trespass of time he resented; the barrenness
of his hope he grieved.</p>
<p>There he was in those Septembral days, galloping
along toward the age limit and retirement. Within
a few weeks he would be subject to call before the
retiring board any day, and there was nothing in his
short-remaining time of service to shore up longer
the hope of advancement in rank as compensatory
honor in his retirement. He was a testy little old
man, charged for instant explosion, and it was generally
understood by everybody but the colonel himself
that the department had sent him off to Fort
Shakie to get him out of the way.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day following Nola
Chadron&rsquo;s ball, when Major King returned to
Frances the glove that Alan Macdonald had carried
away from the garden, Colonel Landcraft was a passenger
on the mail stage from Meander to the post.
The colonel had been on official business to the army
post at Cheyenne. Instead of telegraphing to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' ></a>68</span>
own post the intelligence of his return, and calling
for a proper equipage to meet him at the railroad
end, he had chosen to come back in this secret and
unexpected way.</p>
<p>That was true to the colonel&rsquo;s manner. Perhaps
he hoped to catch somebody overstepping the line
of decorum, regulations, forms, either in the conduct
of the post&rsquo;s business or his own household. For
the colonel was as much a tyrant in one place as the
other. So he eliminated himself, wrapped to the
bushy eyebrows in his greatcoat, for there was a
chilliness in the afternoon, and clouds were driving
over the sun.</p>
<p>His austerity silenced the talkative driver, and
when the stage reached the hotel the colonel parted
from him without a word and clicked away briskly
on his military heels&mdash;built up to give him stature&mdash;to
see what he might surprise out of joint at
the post.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a shock to his valuation of his own
indispensability to find everything in proper form
at the post. The sentry paced before the flagstaff,
decorum prevailed. There was not one small particular
loose to give him ground for flying at the culpable
person and raking him with his blistering fire.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft turned into his own house with
a countenance somewhat fallen as a consequence of
this discovery. It seemed to bear home to him the
fact that the United States Army would get along
very neatly and placidly without him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' ></a>69</span></div>
<p>The colonel occupied one wing of his sprawling,
commodious, and somewhat impressive house as official
headquarters. This room was full of stiff
bookcases, letter files, severe chairs. The colonel&rsquo;s
desk stood near the fireplace in a strong light, with
nothing ever unfinished left upon it. It was one of
the colonel&rsquo;s greatest satisfactions in life that he always
was ready to snap down the cover of that desk
at a moment&rsquo;s notice and march away upon a campaign
to the world&rsquo;s end&mdash;and his own&mdash;leaving
everything clear behind him.</p>
<p>A private walk led up to a private door in the
colonel&rsquo;s quarters, where a private in uniform, with
a rifle on his shoulder, made a formal parade when
the colonel was within, and accessible to the military
world for the transaction of business. This sentinel
was not on duty now, the return of the colonel being
unlooked-for, and nobody was the wiser in that household
when the master of it let himself into the room
with his key.</p>
<p>The day was merging into dusk, or the colonel
probably would have been aware that a man was
hastening after him along the leaf-strewn walk as
he passed up the avenue to his home. He was not
many rods behind the colonel, and was gaining on
him rapidly, when the crabbed old gentleman closed
his office door softly behind him.</p>
<p>The unmilitary visitor&mdash;this fact was betrayed by
both his gait and his dress&mdash;turned sharply in upon
the private walk and followed the colonel to his door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' ></a>70</span>
He was turning through the letters and telegrams
which had arrived during his absence when the visitor
laid hand to the bell.</p>
<p>No sound of ringing followed this application to
the thumbscrew arrangement on the door, for the
colonel had taken the bell away long ago. But there
resulted a clucking, which brought the colonel to the
portal frowning and alert, warming in the expectation
of having somebody whom he might dress down
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Landcraft, I beg the favor of a word in
private,&rdquo; said the stranger at the door.</p>
<p>The colonel opened the door wider, and peered
sharply at the visitor, a frown gathering on his unfriendly
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the honor&rdquo;&mdash;he began stiffly, seeing
that it was an inferior civilian, for all civilians, except
the president, were inferior to the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald is my name. I am a rancher in this
country; you will have heard of me,&rdquo; the visitor replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to your credit, young man,&rdquo; said the
colonel, tartly. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s chance,&rdquo; said Macdonald, earnestly.
&ldquo;Will you let me explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft stood out of the doorway;
Macdonald entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a light,&rdquo; said the colonel, lowering the
window-shades before he struck the match. When
he had the flame of the student&rsquo;s lamp on top of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' ></a>71</span>
desk regulated to conform to his exactions, the colonel
faced about suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am listening, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning, sir, I want you to know who
I am,&rdquo; said Macdonald, producing papers. &ldquo;My
father, Senator Hampden Macdonald of Maine, now
lives in Washington. You have heard of him. I am
Alan Macdonald, late of the United States consular
service. It is unlikely that you ever heard of me in
that connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of you before I came here,&rdquo; said the
colonel, unfavorably, unfolding the credentials which
the visitor had placed on his desk, and skimming them
with cursory eye. Now he looked up from his reading
with a sudden little jerk of the head, and stood
at severe attention. &ldquo;And the purpose of this visit,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, to prove to you that the notorious character
given me by the cattlemen of this country is
slanderous and unwarranted; secondly, to ask you
to give me a man&rsquo;s chance, as I have said, in a matter
to which I shall come without loss of words. I am a
gentleman, and the son of a gentleman; I do not
acknowledge any moral or social superiors in this
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel, drew himself up a notch, and seemed
to grow a little at that. He looked hard at the tall,
fair-haired, sober-faced man in front of him, as if
searching out his points to justify the bold claim
upon respectability that he had made. Macdonald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' ></a>72</span>
was dressed in almost military precision; the colonel
could find no fault with that. His riding-breeches
told that they had been cut for no other legs, his coat
set to his shoulders with gentlemanly ease. Only his
rather greasy sombrero, with its weighty leather band,
and the bulging revolvers under his coat seemed out
of place in the general trimness of his attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; the colonel said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the honor of meeting Miss Landcraft last
night at the masquerade given by Miss Chadron&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that, sir? Did you have the effrontery
to force yourself into a company which despises you,
at the risk of your life and the decorum of the assemblage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was drawn there,&rdquo; Macdonald spoke slowly,
meeting the colonel&rsquo;s cold eye with steady gaze, &ldquo;by
a hope that was miraculously realized. I did risk my
life, and I almost lost it. But that is nothing unusual&mdash;I
risk it every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw Miss Landcraft at the ball, danced with
her, I suppose, talked with her,&rdquo; nodded the colonel,
understandingly. &ldquo;Macdonald, you are a bold, a
foolishly bold, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Miss Landcraft, I danced with her, I talked
with her, and I have come to you, sir, after a desperate
ride through the night to save my life as the penalty
of those few minutes of pleasure, to request the
privilege of calling upon Miss Landcraft and paying
my court to her. I ask you to give me a man&rsquo;s chance
to win her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' ></a>73</span></div>
<p>The audacity of the request almost tied the colonel&rsquo;s
sharp old tongue. For a moment he stood with
his mouth open, his face red in the gathering storm of
his sudden passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said he, in amazed, unbelieving voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are my credentials&mdash;they will bear investigation,&rdquo;
Macdonald said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn your credentials, sir! I&rsquo;ll have nothing to
do with them, you blackguard, you scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you to consider&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can consider nothing but the present fact that
you are accused of deeds of outlawry and violence,
and are an outcast of society, even the crude society
of this wild country, sir. No matter who you are or
whence you sprung, the evidence in this country is
against you. You are a brigand and a thief, sir&mdash;this
act of barbaric impetuosity in itself condemns
you&mdash;no civilized man would have the effrontery to
force himself into my presence in such a manner and
make this insane demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am exercising a gentleman&rsquo;s prerogative,
Colonel Landcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a vulture aspiring to soar among eagles,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard only the cattlemen&rsquo;s side of the
story, Colonel Landcraft,&rdquo; said Macdonald, with
patience and restraint. &ldquo;You know that every man
who attempts to build a fence around his cabin in
this country, and strikes a furrow in the ground, is
a rustler according to their creed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' ></a>74</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware that there is narrowness, injustice
even, on the drovers&rsquo; side,&rdquo; the colonel admitted,
softening a little, it seemed. &ldquo;But for all that, even
if you were an equal, and an honest man, the road to
Miss Landcraft&rsquo;s heart is closed to assault, no matter
how wild and sudden. She is plighted to another
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true; she will be married in the Christmas
holidays. Go your way now, Macdonald, and dismiss
this romantic dream. You build too high on the
slight favor of a thoughtless girl. A dance or two is
nothing, sir; a whispered word is less. If you were
the broad man of the world that you would have me
believe, you have known this. Instead, you come
dashing in here like a savage and claim the right to
woo her. Preposterous! She is beyond your world,
sir. Go back to your wild riding, Macdonald, and
try to live an honest man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald stood with his head bent, brows gathered
in stubborn expression of resistance. Colonel
Landcraft could read in his face that there was no
surrender, no acknowledgment of defeat, in that wild
rider&rsquo;s heart. The old warrior felt a warming of
admiration for him, as one brave man feels for another,
no matter what differences lie between them.
Now Macdonald lifted his face, and there was that
deep movement of laughter in his eyes that Frances
had found so marvelous on the day of their first
meeting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' ></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps her heart is untouched, sir, in spite of
the barricade that has been raised between it and the
world,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The colonel studied him shrewdly a little while before
replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald, you&rsquo;re a strange man, a stubborn
man, and a strong one. There is work for a man
like you in this life; why are you wasting it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I live six months longer the world beyond these
mountains will know,&rdquo; was all that Macdonald said,
taking up the papers which he had submitted to the
colonel, and placing them again in his pocket.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running off other men&rsquo;s cattle never will do it,
Macdonald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the colonel&rsquo;s room which gave into the
hall of the main entrance opened without the formality
of announcement. Frances drew back in quick
confusion, speaking her apology from behind the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask your pardon, father. I heard voices here
and wondered who it could be&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know you
had come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your appearance is opportune, Miss Landcraft,&rdquo;
her father told her, with no trace of ill-humor.
&ldquo;Come in. Here is this wild Alan Macdonald come
bursting in upon us from his hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel indicated him with a wave of the hand,
and Macdonald bowed, his heart shrinking when he
saw how coldly she returned his greeting from her
place at the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' ></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He has come riding,&rdquo; the colonel continued,
&ldquo;with a demand on me to be allowed to woo you, and
carry you off to his cave among the rocks. Show him
the door, and add your testimony to my assurance&mdash;which
seems inadequate to satisfy the impetuous
gentleman&mdash;that his case is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel waved them away with that, and
turned again, with his jerky suddenness, to his telegrams
and letters. The colonel had not meant for
Macdonald to pass out of the door through which
he had entered. That was the military portal; the
other one, opening into the hall from which Frances
came, was the world&rsquo;s door for entering that house.
And it was in that direction Colonel Landcraft had
waved them when he ordered Frances to take the
visitor away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Mr. Macdonald, please,&rdquo; said she,
politely cold, unfeelingly formal. For all the warmth
that he could discover in her voice and eyes, or in
her white face, so unaccountably severe and hard,
there might never have been a garden with white
gravel path, or a hot hasty kiss given in it&mdash;and
received.</p>
<p>In the hall the gloom of evening was deepened into
darkness that made her face indistinct, like the glimmering
whiteness of the hydrangea blooms in that
past romantic night. She marched straight to the
street door and opened it, and he had no strength in
his words to lift even a small one up to stay her.
He believed that he had taken the man&rsquo;s course and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' ></a>77</span>
the way of honor in the matter. That it had not
been indorsed by her was evident, he believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing for me to conceal,&rdquo; said he, as
the door opened upon the gray twilight and glooming
trees along the street; &ldquo;I came in a man&rsquo;s way, as I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came in a man&rsquo;s way, Mr. Macdonald, to ask
the privilege of attempting to win a woman&rsquo;s hand,
when you lack the man&rsquo;s strength or the man&rsquo;s
courage to defend even the glove that covers it,&rdquo; she
said. Her voice was low; it was accusingly scornful.</p>
<p>Macdonald started. &ldquo;Then it has come back to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has come back to me, through a channel that
I would have given the hand that wore it&rdquo;&mdash;she
stretched it out as she spoke; it glimmered like a
nebulous star in misty skies there in the gloom before
his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;to have kept the knowledge from!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost it,&rdquo; said he, drawing himself up as if to
withstand a blow, &ldquo;and in this hour I can plead no
mitigation. A man should have put his life down for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been expected&mdash;of a man,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ask you not to borrow trouble over the
circumstance of its return to you, Miss Landcraft,&rdquo;
he said, cold now in his word, and lofty. &ldquo;You
dropped it on the ballroom floor or in the garden
path, and I, the cattle thief, found it and carried it
away, to show it as evidence of a shadowy conquest,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' ></a>78</span>
maybe, among my wild and lawless kind. Beyond
that you know nothing&mdash;you lost it, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the door he turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If time and events prove so unkind to me that I
never come to a vindication in this country,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;just go on thinking of me as a thief and a wild
rider, and a man of the night. Good-bye, Miss Landcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed the door, and stood cooling from her
sudden resentment at seeing him there alive when her
heart had told her that he must be lying dead in the
dust of the river trail. She should not have been so
suddenly resentful, she now believed. Perhaps there
were mitigating circumstances which he would not
stoop to explain unasked. Her heart bounded with
the thought; warm blood came spreading in her
cheeks.</p>
<p>But Alan Macdonald was gone; misjudged and unjustly
condemned, she now believed, remorse assailing
her. Now the fault could not be repaired, for he was
not the man to come back. But there was much in
knowing that she had not been mistaken in the beginning;
comfort and pride in the full knowledge that
he was a <i>man!</i> Only a man would have come, bravely
and sincerely, in that manner to her father; only a
man would have put his hurt behind him like that and
marched away from her, too proud to stoop to the
mean expedient of begging her to allow him to explain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' ></a>79</span></div>
<p>She sighed as she turned back into the room where
the colonel sat at his desk, but her cheek was hot,
her bosom agitated by an uplifting of pride. The
colonel turned, with inquiring impatience, a letter in
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he nodded, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come back to tell you, father, that I
have broken my engagement with Major King,
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save you embarrassment in your future relations
with him,&rdquo; she concluded, unshaken.</p>
<p>The colonel was standing now; his face reflecting
the anger that boiled in his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, miss, you can&rsquo;t break your engagement
to Major King! That is out of your power, beyond
you, entirely. It rests with me, and with me solely,
to terminate any such obligation. I have pledged a
soldier&rsquo;s word and a soldier&rsquo;s honor in this matter,
miss. It is incumbent on you to see that both are
redeemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a mind to do my own thinking now, father;
I&rsquo;m old enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman is never old enough to know her own
mind! What&rsquo;s the occasion of this change in the
wind? Surely not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft&rsquo;s brows drew together over his
thin nose, making small glaring points of his blue
eyes among the gathered wrinkles and bristling hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' ></a>80</span>
He held his words suspended while he searched her
face for justification of his pent arraignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said he at last, letting his breath go
with the word, as if relief had come. &ldquo;Put the notion
out of your head, for you are going to marry Major
King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, father, you must adjust yourself to
my decision in this matter. I am not going to marry
Major King. I have told him so, and it is final.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His own stubbornness, his own fire, was reflected in
her as she spoke. But Colonel Landcraft was not to
be moved from what he considered his right to dispose
of her in a way that he believed would be an honor to
the army and a glory to the nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry Major King, or die a maid!&rdquo; he
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, father,&rdquo; she returned, in ambiguous
concession.</p>
<p>She left him frowning among his papers. In his
small, tyrannical way he had settled that case, finally
and completely, to his own thinking, as he had disposed
of wild-riding Alan Macdonald and his bold,
outlandish petition.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THROWING THE SCARE</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Banjo Gibson arrived at Macdonald&rsquo;s place
the following day, from Sam Hatcher&rsquo;s ranch
across the river, bringing news that three homesteaders
on that side had been killed in the past two days.
They had been shot from the willow thickets as they
worked in their fields or rode along the dim-marked
highways. Banjo could not give any further particulars;
he did not know the victims&rsquo; names.</p>
<p>Macdonald understood what it meant, and whose
hand was behind the slaying of those home-makers of
the wilderness. It was not a new procedure in the
cattle barons&rsquo; land; this scourge had been fore-shadowed
in that list of names which Frances Landcraft
had given him.</p>
<p>The word had gone out to them to be on guard.
Now death had begun to leap upon them from the
roadside grass. Perhaps his own turn would come
tonight or tomorrow. He could not be more watchful
than his neighbors had been; no man could close
all the doors.</p>
<p>The price of life in that country for such men as
himself always had been unceasing vigilance. When
a man stood guard over himself day and night he
could do no more, and even at that he was almost
certain, some time or other, to leave a chink open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' ></a>82</span>
through which the waiting blow might fall. After a
time one became hardened to this condition of life.
The strain of watching fell away from him; it became
a part of his daily habit, and a man grew careless
about securing the safeguards upon his life by and
by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them fellers,&rdquo; said Banjo, feeling that he had
lowered himself considerably in carrying the news
involving their swift end to Macdonald, &ldquo;got about
what was comin&rsquo; to &rsquo;em I reckon, Mac. Why don&rsquo;t
a man like you hitch up with Chadron or Hatcher, or
one of the good men of this country, and git out
from amongst them runts that&rsquo;s nosin&rsquo; around in the
ground for a livin&rsquo; like a drove of hogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man to his liking, Banjo,&rdquo; Macdonald
returned, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like the company you&rsquo;ve
named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They never quarreled over the point, but Banjo
never ceased to urge the reformation, such as he
honestly believed it to be, upon Macdonald at every
visit. The little troubadour felt that he was doing
a generous and friendly turn for a fallen man, and
squaring his own account with Macdonald in thus
laboring for his redemption.</p>
<p>Banjo was under obligation to Macdonald for
no smaller matter than his life, the homesteader
having rescued him from drowning the past spring
when the musician, heading for Chadron&rsquo;s after playing
for a dance, had mistaken the river for the road
and stubbornly urged his horse into it. On that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' ></a>83</span>
occasion Banjo&rsquo;s wits had been mixed with liquor,
but his sense of gratitude had been perfectly clear
ever since. Macdonald&rsquo;s door was the only one in
the nesters&rsquo; colony that stress or friendship ever had
constrained him to enter. Even as it was, with all
the big debt of gratitude owing, his intimacy with a
man who had opened an irrigation ditch was a thing
of which he did not boast abroad.</p>
<p>Banjo made but a night&rsquo;s stop of it with Macdonald.
Early in the morning he was in the saddle
again, with a dance ahead of him to play for that
night at a ranch twenty miles or more away. He
lingered a little after shaking hands with his host,
trying the violin case as if to see that it was secure,
and fidgeting in his saddle, and holding back on the
start. Macdonald could see that there was something
unsaid in the little man&rsquo;s mind which gave him an
uneasiness, like indigestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Banjo?&rdquo; he asked, to let it be known
that he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac, did you ever hear tell of a feller named
Mark Thorn?&rdquo; Banjo inquired, looking about him
with fearful caution, lowering his voice almost to a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about that, Banjo?&rdquo; Macdonald&rsquo;s
face was troubled; he moved nearer the musician as
he made the inquiry, and laid his hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here. He&rsquo;s the feller you&rsquo;ve got to watch out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' ></a>84</span>
for. He cut acrosst the road yisterday afternoon
when I was comin&rsquo; down here, and when he seen me
he stopped, for I used to know him up north and
he knew it wasn&rsquo;t no use to try to duck and hide
his murderin&rsquo; face from me. He told me he was
ranchin&rsquo; up in Montany, and he&rsquo;d come down here to
collect some money Chadron owed him on an old
bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty slim kind of a story. But he&rsquo;s here to
collect money from Chadron, all right, and give him
value received. What kind of a looking man is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s long and lean, like a rail, with a kind of a
bend in him when he walks, and the under lid of his
left eye drawed like you&rsquo;d pulled it down and stuck
a tack in it. He&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo; a cap, and he&rsquo;s kind of
whiskered up, like he&rsquo;d been layin&rsquo; out some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know him,&rdquo; Macdonald nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t miss him in a thousand, Mac. Well,
I must be rackin&rsquo; along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo scarcely had passed out of sight when three
horsemen came galloping to Macdonald&rsquo;s gate. They
brought news of a fresh tragedy, and that in the
immediate neighborhood. A boy had been shot down
that morning while doing chores on a homestead a
little way across the river. He was the son of one
of the men on the death-list, and these men, the
father among them, had come to enlist Macdonald&rsquo;s
aid in running down the slayer.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s mother had seen the assassin hastening
away among the scant bushes on the slope above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' ></a>85</span>
house. The description that she gave of him left
no doubt in Macdonald&rsquo;s mind of his identity. It
was Mark Thorn, the cattlemen&rsquo;s contract killer, the
homesteaders&rsquo; scourge.</p>
<p>It was a fruitless search that day, seeking old
Mark Thorn among the hills which rose brokenly a
few miles back from the river and climbed to the
knees of the mountains in ever-mounting surge. A
devil&rsquo;s darning-needle in a cornfield would have been
traced and cornered as quickly as that slippery thin
old killer of men, it seemed.</p>
<p>As if to show his contempt for those who hunted
him, and to emphasize his own feeling of security,
he slipped down to the edge of the fenced lands and
struck down another homesteader that afternoon,
leaving him dead at the handles of his plow.</p>
<p>Those homesteaders were men of rare courage and
unbending persistency in the ordinary affairs of life,
but three days of empty pursuit of this monster left
them out of heart. The name of Mark Thorn in
itself was sufficient to move a thrill of terror and
repulsion. He had left his red mark in many places
through the land dominated by the cattle interests
of the Northwest, where settlers had attempted to
find lodgment. He had come at length to stand for
an institution of destruction, rather than an individual,
which there was no power strong enough to
circumvent, nor force cunning enough to entrap.</p>
<p>There never was a tale of monsters, wolf-men,
bloody-muzzled great beasts of dark forests, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' ></a>86</span>
struck deeper fear into the hearts of primitive peasantry
than this modern ogre moved in the minds and
hearts of those striving settlers in the cattle lands.
Mark Thorn was a shadowy, far-reaching thing to
them, distorted in their imaginings out of the semblance
of a man. He had grown, in the stories
founded on facts horrible enough without enlargement,
into a fateful destroyer, from whom no man
upon whom he had set his mark could escape.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that fear for the safety of
their wives and children made the faces of these men
gray as they rode the sage, combing the hollows and
hills for the sight of old Mark Thorn. One by one
they began to drop out of the posse, until of the fourteen
besides Macdonald who had ridden in the hunt
on the second day, only five remained on the evening
of the third.</p>
<p>It was no use looking for Mark Thorn, they said,
shaking gloomy heads. When he came into a country
on a contract to kill, it was like a curse predestined
which the power of man could not turn aside. He
had the backing of the Drovers&rsquo; Association, which
had an arm as long in that land as the old Persian
king&rsquo;s. He would strike there, like the ghost of all
the devils in men that ever had lived on their fellows&rsquo;
blood, and slink away as silently as a wolf out
of the sheepfold at dawn when his allotted task was
done.</p>
<p>Better to go home and guard what was left, they
said. All of them were men for a fight, but it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' ></a>87</span>
one thing to stand up to something that a man could
see, and quite another to fight blindfolded, and in
the dark. Catching Mark Thorn was like trying to
ladle moonlight with a sieve. The country wasn&rsquo;t
worth it, they were beginning to believe. When Mark
Thorn came in, it was like the vultures flying ahead
of the last, devastating plague.</p>
<p>The man whose boy had been shot down beside the
little grass-roofed barn was the last to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to it for a year, Alan, if you think it&rsquo;s
any use,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He was a gaunt man, with sunken cheeks and weary
eyes; gray, worn, unwashed, and old; one of the
earth&rsquo;s disinherited who believed that he had come
into his rood of land at last. Now the driving
shadow of his restless fate was on him again. Macdonald
could see that it was heavy in his mind to
hitch up and stagger on into the west, which was
already red with the sunset of his day.</p>
<p>Macdonald was moved by a great compassion for
this old man, whose hope had been snatched away
from him by the sting of a bullet in the dawn. He
laid his hand on the old homesteader&rsquo;s sagging thin
shoulder and poured the comfort of a strong man&rsquo;s
sympathy into his empty eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on back, Tom, and look after the others,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Do your chores by dark, morning and
night, and stick close to cover all days and watch for
him. I&rsquo;ll keep on looking. I started to get that old
hyena, and I&rsquo;ll get him. Go on home.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' ></a>88</span></div>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes kindled with admiration. But
it died as quickly as it had leaped up, and he shook
his long hair with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; agin him all alone, Alan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have a better chance alone than in
a crowd, Tom. There&rsquo;s no doubt that there were too
many of us, crashing through the brush and setting
ourselves up against the sky line every time we rode
up a hill. I&rsquo;ll tackle him alone. Tell the neighbors
to live under cover till they hear I&rsquo;ve either got him
or he&rsquo;s got me. In case it turns out against me, they
can do whatever seems best to them.&rdquo;</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_VIII_AFOOT_AND_ALONE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>AFOOT AND ALONE</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Mark Thorn had not killed anybody since
shooting the man at the plow. There were
five deaths to his credit on that contract, although
none of the fallen was on the cattlemen&rsquo;s list of desirables
to be removed.</p>
<p>Five days had passed without a tragedy, and the
homesteaders were beginning to draw breath in the
open again, in the belief that Macdonald must have
driven the slayer out of the country. Nothing had
been seen or heard of Macdonald since the evening
that he parted company with Tom Lassiter, father
of the murdered boy.</p>
<p>Macdonald, in the interval, was hard on the old
villain&rsquo;s trail. He had picked it up on the first day
of his lone-handed hunt, and once he had caught a
glimpse of Thorn as he dodged among the red willows
on the river, but the sight had been too transitory
to put in a shot. It was evident now that Thorn
knew that he was being hunted by a single pursuer.
More than that, there were indications written in the
loose earth where he passed, and in the tangled brushwood
where he skulked, that he had stopped running
away and had turned to hunt the hunter.</p>
<p>For two days they had been circling in a constantly
tightening ring, first one leading the hunt, then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' ></a>90</span>
other. Trained and accustomed as he was to life
under those conditions, Thorn had not yet been able
to take even a chance shot at his clinging pursuer.</p>
<p>Macdonald was awake to the fact that this balance
in his favor could not be maintained long. As it
was, he ascribed it more to luck than skill on his
part. This wild beast in human semblance must
possess all the wild beast&rsquo;s cunning; there would be
a rift left open in this straining game of hide and
seek which his keen eyes would be sure to see at no
distant hour.</p>
<p>The afternoon of that day was worn down to the
hock. Macdonald had been creeping and stooping,
running, panting, and lying concealed from the first
gleam of dawn. Whether by design on the part of
Thorn, or merely the blind leading of the hunt,
Macdonald could not tell, the contest of wits had
brought them within sight of Alamito ranchhouse.</p>
<p>Resting a little while with his back against a ledge
which insured him from surprise, Macdonald looked
out from the hills over the wide-spanning valley, the
farther shore of which was laved in a purple mist as
rich as the dye of some oriental weaving. He felt
a surge of indignant protest against the greedy
injustice of that manorial estate, the fair house
glistening in the late sun among the white-limbed
cottonwoods. There Saul Chadron sat, like some distended
monster, his hands spread upon more than he
could honestly use, or his progeny after him for a
thousand years, growling and snapping at all whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' ></a>91</span>
steps lagged in passing, or whose weary eyes turned
longingly toward those grassy vales.</p>
<p>There had been frost for many nights past; the
green of the summerland had merged into a yellow-brown,
now gold beneath the slanting sunbeams. A
place of friendly beauty and sequestered peace, where
a man might come to take up his young dreams, or
stagger under the oppression of his years to put them
down, and rest. It seemed so, in the light of that
failing afternoon.</p>
<p>But the man who sat with his back against the
ledge, his ears strained to find the slightest hostile
sound, his roaming eyes always coming back with
unconscious alertness and frowning investigation to
the nearer objects in the broken foreground, had
tasted beneath the illusive crust of that land, and the
savor was bitter upon his lips. He questioned what
good there was to be got out of it, for him or those
for whom he had taken up the burden, for many a
weary year to come.</p>
<p>The gloom of the situation bore heavily upon him;
he felt the uselessness of his fight. He recalled the
words of Frances Landcraft: &ldquo;There must be millions
behind the cattlemen.&rdquo; He felt that he never
had realized the weight of millions, iniquitous millions,
before that hour. They formed a barrier which his
shoulder seemed destined never to overturn.</p>
<p>There he was, on that broad heath, afoot and alone,
hunting, and hunted by a slayer of men, one who
stalked him as he would a wolf or a lion for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' ></a>92</span>
bounty upon his head. And in the event that a lucky
shot should rid the earth of that foul thing, how much
would it strengthen his safety, and his neighbors&rsquo;, and
fasten their weak hold upon the land?</p>
<p>Little, indeed. Others could be hired out of those
uncounted millions of the cattlemen&rsquo;s resources to
finish what Mark Thorn had begun. The night
raids upon their fields would continue, the slanders
against them would spread and grow. Colonel Landcraft
believed him to be what malicious report had
named him; there was not a doubt of that. And what
Frances thought of him since that misadventure of
the glove, it was not hard to guess.</p>
<p>But that was not closed between them, he told himself,
as he had told himself before, times unnumbered.
There was a final word to be said, at the right time
and place. The world would turn many times between
then and the Christmas holidays, when Frances was
to become the bride of another, according to the
colonel&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Macdonald was weary from his night vigils and
stealthy prowlings by day, and hungry for a hot
meal. Since he had taken the trail of Mark Thorn
alone he had not kindled a fire. Now the food that
he had carried with him was done; he must turn back
home for a fresh supply, and a night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>It did not matter much, anyway, he said, feeling
the uselessness of his life and strife in that place. It
was a big and unfriendly land, a hard and hopeless
place for a man who tried to live in defiance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' ></a>93</span>
established order there. Why not leave it, with its
despair and heart-emptiness? The world was full
enough of injustices elsewhere if he cared to set his
hand to right them.</p>
<p>But a true man did not run away under fire, nor
a brave one block out a task and then shudder and
slink away, when he stood off and saw the immensity
of the thing that he had undertaken. Besides all
these considerations, which in themselves formed insuperable
reasons against retreat, there had been
some big talk into the ear of Frances Landcraft.
There was no putting down what he had begun. His
dream had taken root there; it would be cruel cowardice
to wrench it up.</p>
<p>He got up, the sun striking him on the face, from
which the west wind pressed back his hat brim as if
to let the daylight see it. The dust of his travels was
on it, and the roughness of his new beard, and it was
harsh in some of its lines, and severe as an ashlar
from the craftsman&rsquo;s tool. But it was a man&rsquo;s face,
with honor in it; the sun found no weakness there, no
shame concealed under the sophistries and wiles by
which men beguile the world.</p>
<p>Macdonald looked away across the valley, past the
white ranchhouse, beyond the slow river which came
down from the northwest in toilsome curves, whose
gray shores and bars were yellow in that sunlight as
the sands of famed Pactolus. His breast heaved with
the long inspiration which flared his thin nostrils like
an Arab&rsquo;s scenting rain; he revived with a new vigor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' ></a>94</span>
as the freedom of the plains met his eyes and made
them glad. That was his place, his land; its troubles
were his to bear, its peace his to glean when it should
ripen. It was his inheritance; it was his place of rest.
The lure of that country had a deep seat in his heart;
he loved it for its perils and its pains. It was like
a sweetheart to bind and call him back. A man makes
his own Fortunate Isles, as that shaggy old gray poet
knew so well.</p>
<p>For a moment Mark Thorn was forgotten as
Macdonald repeated, in low voice above his breath:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Lo! These are the isles of the watery miles</p>
<p>That God let down from the firmament.</p>
<p>Lo! Duty and Love, and a true man&rsquo;s trust;</p>
<p>Your forehead to God and your feet in the dust&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>Yes, that was his country; it had taken hold of
him with that grip which no man ever has shaken
his heart free from, no matter how many seas he has
placed between its mystic lure and his back-straining
soul. Its fight was his fight, and there was gladness
in the thought.</p>
<p>His alertness as he went down the slope, and the
grim purpose of his presence in that forbidden place,
did not prevent the pleading of a softer cause, and
a sweeter. That rare smile woke in his eyes and unbent
for a moment the harshness of his lips as he
thought of brown hair sweeping back from a white
forehead, and a chin lifted imperiously, as became
one born to countenance only the exalted in this life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' ></a>95</span>
There was something that made him breathe quicker
in the memory of her warm body held a transitory
moment in his arms; the recollection of the rose-softness
of her lips. All these were waiting in the
world that he must win, claimed by another, true.
But that was immaterial, he told his heart, which
leaped and exulted in the memory of that garden path
as if there was no tomorrow, and no such shadow in
man&rsquo;s life as doubt.</p>
<p>Of course, there remained the matter of the glove.
A man might have been expected to die before yielding
it to another, as she had said, speaking out of a
hot heart, he knew. There was a more comfortable
thought for Alan Macdonald as he went down the
long slope with the western sun on his face; not a
thought of dying for a glove, but of living to win
the hand that it had covered.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s ranchhouse was several miles to the
westward of him, although it appeared nearer by the
trickery of that clear light. He cut his course to
bring himself into the public highway&mdash;a government
road, it was&mdash;that ran northward up the river,
the road along which Chadron&rsquo;s men had pursued him
the night of the ball. He meant to strike it some
miles to the north of Chadron&rsquo;s homestead, for he
was not looking for any more trouble than he was
carrying that day.</p>
<p>He proceeded swiftly, but cautiously, watching for
his man. But Mark Thorn did not appear to be
abroad in that part of the country. Until sundown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' ></a>96</span>
Macdonald walked unchallenged, when he struck the
highway a short distance south of the point where
the trail leading to Fort Shakie branched from it.</p>
<p>Saul Chadron and his daughter Nola came riding
out of the Fort Shakie road, their horses in that tireless,
swinging gallop which the animals of that rare
atmosphere can maintain for hours. As he rode,
Chadron swung his quirt in unison with the horse&rsquo;s
undulations, from side to side across its neck, like
a baton. He sat as stiff and solid in his saddle as
a carved image. Nola came on neck and neck with
him, on the side of the road nearer Macdonald.</p>
<p>Macdonald was carrying a rifle in addition to his
side arms, and he was a dusty grim figure to come
upon suddenly afoot in the high road. Chadron
pulled in his horse and brought it to a stiff-legged
stop when he saw Macdonald, who had stepped to
the roadside to let them pass. The old cattleman&rsquo;s
high-crowned sombrero was pinched to a peak; the
wind of his galloping gait had pressed its broad brim
back from his tough old weathered face. His white
mustache and little dab of pointed beard seemed
whiter against the darkness of passion which mounted
to his scowling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the hell&rsquo;re you up to now?&rdquo; he demanded,
without regard for his companion, who was
accustomed, well enough, to his explosions and expletives.</p>
<p>Macdonald gravely lifted his hand to his hat, his
eyes meeting Nola&rsquo;s for an instant, Chadron&rsquo;s challenge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' ></a>97</span>
unanswered. Nola&rsquo;s face flared at this respectful
salutation as if she had been insulted. She jerked
her horse back a little, as if she feared that violence
would follow the invasion of her caste by this fallen
and branded man, her pliant waist weaving in graceful
balance with every movement of her beast.</p>
<p>Macdonald lowered his eyes from her blazingly
indignant face. Her horse was slewed across the
narrow road, and he considered between waiting for
them to ride on and striking into the shoulder-high
sage which grew thick at the roadside there. He
thought that she was very pretty in her fairness of
hair and skin, and the lake-clear blueness of her eyes.
She was riding astride, as all the women in that
country rode, dressed in wide pantaloonish corduroys,
with twinkling little silver spurs on her heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you prowlin&rsquo; down here around my
place for?&rdquo; Chadron asked, spurring his horse as
he spoke, checking its forward leap with rigid arm,
which made a commotion of hoofs and a cloud of
dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a public highway, and I deny your right
to question my motives in it,&rdquo; Macdonald returned,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneakin&rsquo; around to see if you can lay hands on
a horse, I suppose,&rdquo; Chadron said, leaning a little
in towering menace toward the man in the road.</p>
<p>Macdonald felt a hot surge of resentment rise to
his eyes, so suddenly and so strongly that it dimmed
his sight. He shut his mouth hard on the words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' ></a>98</span>
which sprang into it, and held himself in silence until
he had command of his anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hunting,&rdquo; said he, meeting Chadron&rsquo;s eye
with meaning look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On foot, and waitin&rsquo; for dark!&rdquo; the cattleman
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on foot because the game I&rsquo;m after
sticks close to the ground. There&rsquo;s no need of naming
that game to you&mdash;you know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald spoke with cutting severity. Chadron&rsquo;s
dark face reddened under his steady eyes, and again
the big rowels of his spurs slashed his horse&rsquo;s sides,
making it bound and trample in threatening charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about your damn low
business, but I&rsquo;ll tell you this much; if I ever run
onto you ag&rsquo;in down this way I&rsquo;ll do a little huntin&rsquo;
on my own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be squarer, and more to my liking,
than hiring somebody else to do it for you, Mr. Chadron.
Ride on&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to stand here and quarrel
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to clear you nesters out of there up
the river&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron waved his hand in the direction
of which he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;and put a stop to your rustlin&rsquo;
before another month rolls around. I&rsquo;ve stood your
fences up there on my land as long as I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to tell you before, Mr.
Chadron&rdquo;&mdash;Macdonald spoke as respectfully as his
deep detestation of the cattleman would allow&mdash;&ldquo;but
if you&rsquo;ve got any other charge to bring against me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' ></a>99</span>
except that of homesteading, bring it in a court.
I&rsquo;m ready to face you on it, any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carry my court right here with me,&rdquo; said
Chadron, patting his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny its jurisdiction,&rdquo; Macdonald returned,
drawing himself up, a flash of defiance in his clear
eyes.</p>
<p>Chadron jerked his head in expression of lofty
disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! Git out of my sight!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road is open to you,&rdquo; Macdonald replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to turn my back on you till you&rsquo;re
out of sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron bent his great owlish brows in a scowl,
laid his hand on his revolver and whirled his horse
in the direction that Macdonald was facing.</p>
<p>Macdonald did not answer. He turned from
Chadron, something in his act of going that told the
cattleman he was above so mean suspicion on his
part. Nola shifted her horse to let him pass, her
elbows tight at her sides, scorn in her lively eyes.</p>
<p>Again Macdonald&rsquo;s hand went to his hat in respectful
salute, and again he saw that flash of anger
spread in the young woman&rsquo;s cheeks. Her fury
blazed in her eyes as she looked at him a moment, and
a dull color mounted in his own face as he beheld her
foolish and unjustified pride.</p>
<p>Macdonald would have passed her then, but she
spurred her horse upon him with sudden-breaking
temper, forcing him to spring back quickly to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' ></a>100</span>
roadside to escape being trampled. Before he could
collect himself in his astonishment, she struck him a
whistling blow with her long-thonged quirt across
the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dog!&rdquo; she said, her clenched little white
teeth showing in her parted lips.</p>
<p>Macdonald caught the bridle and pushed her horse
back to its haunches, and she, in her reckless anger,
struck him across the hand in sharp quick blows.
Her conduct was comparable to nothing but that of
an ill-bred child striking one whose situation, he has
been told, is the warrant of his inferiority.</p>
<p>The struggle was over in a few seconds, and Macdonald
stood free of the little fury, a red welt across
his cheek, the back of his hand cut until the blood
oozed through the skin in heavy black drops. Chadron
had not moved a hand to interfere on either side.
Only now that the foolish display of Nola&rsquo;s temper
was done he rocked in his saddle and shook the
empty landscape with his loud, coarse laugh.</p>
<p>He patted his daughter on the shoulder, like a
hunter rewarding a dog. Macdonald walked away
from them, the only humiliation that he felt for the
incident being that which he suffered for her sake.</p>
<p>It was not so much that a woman had debased
herself to the level of a savage, although that hurt
him, too, but that her blows had been the expression
of the contempt in which the lords of that country
held him and his kind. Bullets did not matter so
much, for a man could give them back as hot as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' ></a>101</span>
came. But there was no answer, as he could see it
in that depressing hour, for such a feudal assertion
of superiority as this.</p>
<p>It was to the work of breaking the hold of this
hard-handed aristocracy which had risen from the
grass roots in the day of its arrogant prosperity&mdash;a
prosperity founded on usurpation of the rights of
the weak, and upheld by murder&mdash;that he had set
his soul. The need of hastening the reformation
never had seemed greater to him than on that day,
or more hopeless, he admitted in his heart.</p>
<p>For hour by hour the work ahead of him appeared
to grow greater. Little could be expected, judging
by the experiences of the past few days, from those
who suffered most. The day of extremest pressure
in their poor affairs was being hastened by the cattlemen,
as Chadron&rsquo;s threat had foretold. Would they
when the time came to fight do so, or harness their
lean teams and drive on into the west? That was the
big question upon which the success or the failure of
his work depended.</p>
<p>As he had come down from the hillside out of the
sunshine and peace to meet shadow and violence, so
his high spirits, hopes, and intentions seemed this
bitter hour steeped in sudden gloom. In more ways
than one that evening on the white river road, Alan
Macdonald felt that he was afoot and alone.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>BUSINESS, NOT COMPANY</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Saul Chadron was at breakfast next morning
when Maggie the cook appeared in the dining-room
and announced a visitor for the se&ntilde;or boss.
Maggie&rsquo;s eyes were bulging, and she did a great deal
of pantomime with her shapely shoulders to express
her combined fright, disgust, and indignation.</p>
<p>Chadron looked up from his ham and eggs, with
a considerable portion of the eggs on the blade of
his knife, handle-down in one fist, his fork standing
like a lightning rod in the other, and asked her who
the man was and what he wanted at that hour of the
day. Chadron was eating by lamplight, and alone,
according to his thrifty custom of slipping up on
the day before it was awake, as if in the hope of
surprising it at a vast disadvantage to itself, after
his way of handling men and things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Es un extranjero</i>,&rdquo; replied Maggie, forgetting
her English in her excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk white man, you old sow!&rdquo; Chadron growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ees a es-trenger, I do not knowed to heem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to go to the barn and wait, I&rsquo;ll be out
there in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not a-goed. I told to heem&mdash;whee!&rdquo;
Maggie clamped her hands to her back as if somebody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' ></a>103</span>
had caught her in a ticklish spot, as she
squealed, and jumped into the room where the grand
duke of the cattlemen&rsquo;s nobility was taking his refreshment.</p>
<p>Chadron had returned to his meal after ordering
her to send his visitor to the barn. He was swabbing
his knife in the fold of a pancake when Maggie made
that frightful, shivering exclamation and jumped
aside out of the door. Now he looked up to reprove
her, and met the smoky eyes of Mark Thorn peering
in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo; around here, you old&mdash;come
in&mdash;shut that door! Git him some breakfast,&rdquo; he
ordered, turning to Maggie.</p>
<p>Maggie hung back a moment, until Thorn had
come into the room, then she shot into the kitchen
like a cat through a fence, and slammed the door
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the hell do you mean by comin&rsquo; around
here?&rdquo; Chadron demanded angrily. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell
you never to come here? you blink-eyed old snag-shin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me,&rdquo; Thorn admitted, putting his rifle
down across a chair, drawing another to the table,
and seating himself in readiness for the coming meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;d you sneak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News,&rdquo; said Thorn, in his brief way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which news?&rdquo; Chadron brightened hopefully, his
implements, clamped in his hairy fists, inviting the
first bolt from the heavens.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' ></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I got him last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got&mdash;<i>him?</i>&rdquo; Chadron lifted himself from
his chair on his bent legs in the excitement of the
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m through with this job. I&rsquo;ve come to
cash in, and quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell you say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gittin&rsquo; too old for this kind of work. That
feller chased me around till my tongue was hangin&rsquo;
out so fur I stepped on it. I tell you he was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorn looked at him with a scowl. &ldquo;Well, I never
used a club on a man yit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it happen at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there at his place. He&rsquo;d been chasin&rsquo; me for
two days, and when he went back&mdash;after grub, I
reckon&mdash;I doubled on him. Just as he went in the
door I got him. I left him with his damn feet stickin&rsquo;
out like a shoemaker&rsquo;s sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fur was you off from him, Mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty yards, more &rsquo;r less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go over to him to see if he was finished,
or just creased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never creased a man in my life!&rdquo; Thorn was
indignant over the imputation.</p>
<p>Chadron shook his head, in doubt, in discredit, in
gloomy disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t go up to him and turn him over
and look at the whites of his eyes, you ain&rsquo;t sure,&rdquo;
he protested. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s as slippery as wet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' ></a>105</span>
leather&mdash;he&rsquo;s fooled more than one that thought they had
him, and I&rsquo;ll bet you two bits he&rsquo;s fooled you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see, and settle it yourself, then,&rdquo; Thorn
proposed, in surly humor.</p>
<p>Chadron had suspended his breakfast, as if the
news had come between him and his appetite. He
sat in a study, his big hand curved round his cup,
his gaze on the cloth. At that juncture Maggie
came in with a platter of eggs and ham, which she
put down before Mark Thorn skittishly, ready to
jump at the slightest hostile start. Thorn began to
eat, as calmly as if there was not a stain on his
crippled soul.</p>
<p>Unlike the meal of canned oysters which he had
consumed as Chadron&rsquo;s guest not many days before,
Thorn was not welcomed to this by friendly words
and urging to take off the limit. Chadron sat watching
him, in divided attention and with dark face, as
if he turned troubles over in his mind.</p>
<p>Thorn cleaned the platter in front of him, and
looked round hungrily, like a cat that has half-satisfied
its stomach on a stolen bird. He said nothing,
only he reached his foul hand across the table and
took up the dish containing the remnant of Chadron&rsquo;s
breakfast. This he soon cleared up, when he rasped
the back of his hand across his harsh mustache, like
a vulture preening its filthy plumage, and leaned
back with a full-stomached sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes six,&rdquo; said he, looking hard at Chadron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Chadron grunted, noncommittally.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' ></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I want the money, down on the nail, a thousand
for the job. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to look into it. I ain&rsquo;t payin&rsquo; for anything
sight &rsquo;nseen,&rdquo; Chadron told him, starting out
of his speculative wanderings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money down, on the nail,&rdquo; repeated Thorn, as if
he had not heard. His old cap was hovering over
his long hair, its flaps down like the wings of a brooding
hen. There were clinging bits of broken sage on
it, and burrs, which it had gathered in his skulking
through the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a man up the river right away, and
find out about this last one,&rdquo; Chadron told him,
nodding slowly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got Macdonald&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If hell&rsquo;s got fire in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got him, I&rsquo;ll put something to the
figure agreed on between you and me. The other
fellers you&rsquo;ve knocked over don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang around&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here! You&rsquo;ll not hang around here, I tell
you!&rdquo; Chadron cut him off harshly, fairly bristling.
&ldquo;Snake along out of here, and don&rsquo;t let anybody
see you. I&rsquo;ll meet you at the hotel in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gittin&rsquo; peticlar of your company, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
sneered Thorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not company&mdash;you&rsquo;re business,&rdquo; Chadron
told him, with stern and reproving eyes.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Chadron found Mark Thorn smoking into the
chimney in the hotel office next morning, apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' ></a>107</span>
as if he had not moved from that spot since their
first meeting on that peculiar business. The old man-killer
did not turn his head as Chadron entered the
room with a show of caution and suspicion in his
movements, and closed the door after him.</p>
<p>He crossed over to the fire and stood near Thorn,
who was slouching low in his chair, his long legs
stretched straight, his heels crossed before the low
ashy fire that smoldered in the chimney. For a little
while Chadron stood looking down on his hired
scourge, a knitting of displeasure in his face, as if
he waited for him to break the silence. Thorn continued
his dark reverie undisturbed, it seemed, his
pipestem between his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was his damn hired hand!&rdquo; said Chadron,
with profound disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I heard you say,&rdquo; acknowledged
Thorn, not moving his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew it all the time; you was tryin&rsquo; to work
me for the money, so you could light out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know he had a hired hand!&rdquo; Thorn
drew in his legs, straightened his back, and came with
considerable spirit to the defense of his evil intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t got none now, but <i>he&rsquo;s</i> alive and
kickin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ve bungled on this job worse than an
old woman. I didn&rsquo;t fetch you in here to clean out
hired hands and kids; we can shake a blanket and
scare that kind out of the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, put him in at fifty then, if he was only a
hired hand,&rdquo; said Thorn, willing to oblige.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' ></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When you go ahead and do what you agreed
to, then we&rsquo;ll talk money, and not a red till then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorn got up, unlimbering slowly, and laid the
pipe on the mantel-shelf. He seemed unmoved, indifferent;
apathetic as a toothless old lion. After a
little silence he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done, I tell you,&rdquo; he said querulously, as if
raising the question crossed him. &ldquo;Pay me for that
many, and call it square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring in Macdonald,&rdquo; Chadron demanded in firm
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to touch him! If I keep on after
that man he&rsquo;ll git <i>me</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s on the cards, I can see
it in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re lost your nerve, you old wildcat!&rdquo;
There was a taunt in Chadron&rsquo;s voice, a sneer.</p>
<p>Thorn turned on him, a savage, smothered noise in
his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say that because you owe me money, but
you know it&rsquo;s a damn lie! If you didn&rsquo;t owe me
money, I&rsquo;d make you swaller it with hot lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; a little too free for a man of your
trade, Mark.&rdquo; While Chadron&rsquo;s tone was tolerant,
even friendly, there was an undercurrent of warning,
even threat, in his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the feller that&rsquo;s lettin&rsquo; his gab outrun
his gumption. How many does that make for me,
talkin&rsquo; about nerve, how many? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how many, it lacks one of bein&rsquo;
enough to suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' ></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight, and I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em down in m&rsquo; book
and I can prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it twenty-nine, and then quit if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I will.&rdquo; Thorn leaned forward a little,
a glitter in his smoky eyes.</p>
<p>Chadron fell back, his face growing pale. His
hand was on his weapon, his eyes noting narrowly
every move Thorn made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever sling a gun on me, you old devil, it&rsquo;ll
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to sling no gun on you as long as
you owe me money. I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to cut the bottom
out of m&rsquo; own money-poke, Chad; you don&rsquo;t need
to swivel up in your hide, you ain&rsquo;t marked for
twenty-nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t throw out any more hints like that;
I don&rsquo;t like that kind of a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t touch a hair of your head,&rdquo; Thorn
ran on, following a vein which seemed to amuse him,
for he smiled, a horrible, face-drawing contortion
of a smile, &ldquo;for if you and me ever had a fallin&rsquo; out
over money I might git so hard up I couldn&rsquo;t travel,
and one of them sheriff fellers might slip up on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this fool gab got to do with business?&rdquo;
Chadron was impatient; he looked at his
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d be purty sure to make a speech from
the gallers&mdash;I always intended to&mdash;and lay everything
open that ever took place between me and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' ></a>110</span>
and the rest of them big fellers. There&rsquo;s a newspaper
feller in Cheyenne that wants to make a book
out of m&rsquo; life, with m&rsquo; pict&rsquo;re in the inside of the lid,
to be sold when I&rsquo;m dead. I could git money for
tellin&rsquo; that feller what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and tell him then,&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron spoke with
a dare in his words, and derision&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be easy
money, and it won&rsquo;t call for any nerve. But you
don&rsquo;t need to be plannin&rsquo; any speech from the gallus&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
never go that fur if you try to double-cross
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t aimin&rsquo; to double-cross no man, but you
can call it that if it suits you. You can call it whatever
you purty damn well care to&mdash;I&rsquo;m done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron made no reply to that. He was pulling
on his great gloves, frowning savagely, as if he meant
to close the matter with what he had said, and go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I git any money, or don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Thorn asked,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you bring in that wolf&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to touch that feller, I tell you,
Chad. That man means bad luck to me&mdash;I can read
it in the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you call that kind of skulkin&rsquo; livin&rsquo; up
to your big name?&rdquo; Chadron spoke in derision, playing
on the vanity which he knew to be as much a
part of that old murderer&rsquo;s life as the blood of his
merciless heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got glory enough,&rdquo; said Thorn, satisfaction
in his voice; &ldquo;what I want right now&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' ></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Earn it before you collect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight &rsquo;d fill a purty fair book, countin&rsquo;
in what I could tell about the men I&rsquo;ve had dealin&rsquo;s
with,&rdquo; Thorn reflected, as to himself, leaning against
the mantel, frowning down at the floor with bent
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk till you&rsquo;re empty, you old fool, and who&rsquo;ll
believe you? Huh! you couldn&rsquo;t git yourself hung
if you was to try!&rdquo; Chadron&rsquo;s dark face was blacker
for the spreading flood of resentful blood; he pointed
with his heavy quirt at Thorn, as if to impress him
with a sense of the smallness of his wickedness, which
men would not credit against the cattlemen&rsquo;s word,
even if he should publish it abroad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never
walk onto the scaffold, no matter how hard you try&mdash;there&rsquo;ll
be somebody around to head you off and
give you a shorter cut than that, I&rsquo;m here to tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Thorn, still keeping his thoughtful
pose.</p>
<p>Man-killing is a trade that reacts differently on
those who follow it, according to their depth and
nature. It makes black devils of some who were once
civil, smiling, wholesome men, whether the mischance
of life-taking has fallen to them in their duty to society
or in outlawed deeds. It plunges some into
dark taciturnity and brooding coldness, as if they
had eaten of some root which blunted them to all
common relish of life.</p>
<p>There are others of whom the bloody trade makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' ></a>112</span>
gabbling fools, light-headed, wild-eyed wasters of
words, full of the importance of their mind-wrecking
deeds. Like the savage whose reputation mounts
with each wet scalp, each fresh head, these kill out
of depravity, glorying in the growing score. To this
class Mark Thorn belonged.</p>
<p>There was but one side left to that depraved man&rsquo;s
mind; his bloody, base life had smothered the rest
under the growing heap of his horrible deeds. Thorn
had killed twenty-eight human beings for hire, of
whom he had tally, but there was one to be included
of whom he had not taken count&mdash;himself.</p>
<p>As he stood here against the chimney-shelf he was
only the outside husk of a man. His soul had been
judged already, and burned out of him by the unholy
passion which he had indulged. He was as simple in
his garrulous chatter of glory and distinction as a
half-fool. His warped mind ran only on the spectacular
end that he had planned for himself, and the
speech from the gallows that was to be the black,
damning seal at the end of his atrocious life&rsquo;s record.</p>
<p>Thorn looked up from his study; he shook his
head decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to go back over there in your
country and give you a chance at me. If you git
me, you&rsquo;ll have to git me here. I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to
sling a gun down on nobody for the money that&rsquo;s in
it, I tell you. I&rsquo;m through; I&rsquo;m out of the game; my
craw&rsquo;s full. It&rsquo;s a bad sign when a man wastes a
bullet on a hired hand, takin&rsquo; him for the boss, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' ></a>113</span>
I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to run no more resks on that feller.
When my day for glory comes I&rsquo;ll step out on the
gallers and say m&rsquo; piece, and they&rsquo;ll be some big
fellers in this country huntin&rsquo; the tall grass about
that time, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron had taken up his quirt from the little
round table where the hotel register lay. He turned
now toward the outer door, as if in earnest about
going his way and leaving Mark Thorn to follow
his own path, no matter to what consequences it
might lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re square enough to settle up with me for
this job,&rdquo; said Thorn, &ldquo;and pay me five hundred for
what I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ll leave your name out when I come
to make that little speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron turned on him with a sneer. &ldquo;You seem
to have your hangin&rsquo; all cut and dried, but you&rsquo;ll
never go ten miles outside of this reservation if you
don&rsquo;t turn around and put that job through. You&rsquo;ll
never hang&mdash;you ain&rsquo;t cut out in the hangin&rsquo; style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I will!&rdquo; protested Thorn hotly. &ldquo;I
can see it in the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better shuffle &rsquo;em ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what kind of a day it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be, and
I know just adzackly how I&rsquo;ll look when I hold up
m&rsquo; hands for them fellers to keep still. Shucks! you
can&rsquo;t tell me; I&rsquo;ve seen that day a thousand times.
It&rsquo;ll be early in the mornin&rsquo;, and the sun bright&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door leading to the dining-room opened, and
Thorn left his description of that great and final day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' ></a>114</span>
in his career hanging like a broken bridge. He
turned to see who it was, squinting his old eyes up
sharply, and in watching the stranger he failed to
see the whiteness that came over Chadron&rsquo;s face like
a rushing cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab your gun!&rdquo; Chadron whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let it stay where it is, Thorn,&rdquo; advised the
stranger, his quick hand on his own weapon before
Thorn could grasp what it was all about, believing,
as he did, in the safety of the reservation&rsquo;s neutral
ground. &ldquo;Macdonald is my name; I&rsquo;ve been looking
for you.&rdquo; The stranger came on as he spoke.</p>
<p>He was but a few feet away from Thorn, and the
old man-killer had his revolvers buckled around him
in their accustomed place, while his death-spreading
rifle stood near his hand, leaning its muzzle against
the chimney-jamb. Thorn seemed to be measuring
all the chances which he had left to him in that bold
surprise, and to conclude in the same second that
they were not worth taking.</p>
<p>Macdonald had not drawn his revolver. His hand
was on the butt of it, and his eye held Thorn with a
challenge that the old slayer was in no mind to accept.</p>
<p>Thorn was not a close-fighting man. He never had
killed one of his kind in a face-to-face battle in all
his bloody days. At the bottom he was a coward,
as his skulking deeds attested, and in that moment he
knew that he stood before his master. Slowly he
lifted his long arms above his head, without a word,
and stood in the posture of complete surrender.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' ></a>115</span></div>
<p>Nearer the outer door stood Chadron, to whom
Macdonald seemed to give little attention, as if not
counting him in the game. The big cattleman was
&ldquo;white to the gills,&rdquo; as his kind expressed that state.
Macdonald unbuckled Thorn&rsquo;s belt and hung his
revolvers over his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed you&rsquo;d git me, Macdonald,&rdquo; the old
scoundrel said.</p>
<p>Macdonald, haggard and dusty, and grim as the
last day that old Mark Thorn had pictured for himself,
pushed his prisoner away from the chimney,
out of reach of the rifle, and indicated that he was
to march for the open door, through which the tables
in the dining-room could be seen. At Macdonald&rsquo;s
coming Chadron had thrown his hand to his revolver,
where he still held it, as if undecided how far to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your gun where it is, Chadron,&rdquo; Macdonald
advised. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t my day for you. Clear out of
here&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron backed toward the front door, his hand
still dubiously on his revolver. Still suspicious, his
face as white as it would have been in death, he
reached back with his free hand to open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you he&rsquo;d git me,&rdquo; nodded Thorn, with
something near to exultation in the vindication of his
reading of the cards. &ldquo;I give you a chance&mdash;no
man&rsquo;s money ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to shut my mouth now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shut it, damn you!&rdquo; Chadron&rsquo;s voice was dry-sounding
and far up in his throat. He drew his revolver
with a quick jerk that seemed nothing more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' ></a>116</span>
than a slight movement of the shoulder. Quick as
he was&mdash;and few in the cattlemen&rsquo;s baronies were
ahead of him there&mdash;Macdonald was quicker. The
muzzle of Chadron&rsquo;s pistol was still in the leather
when Macdonald&rsquo;s weapon was leveled at his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that gun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment Chadron&rsquo;s arm hung stiffly in that half-finished
movement, while his eyes gave defiance. He
had not bent before any man in many a year of
growing power. But there was no other way; it
was either bend or break, and the break would be
beyond repair.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s fingers were damp with sudden sweat
as he unclasped them from the pistol-butt and let
the weapon fall; sweat was on his forehead, and a
heaviness on his chest as if a man sat on him. He
felt backwards through the open door with one foot,
like an old man distrustful of his limbs, and steadied
himself with his shoulder against the jamb, for there
was a trembling in his knees. He knew that he had
saved himself from the drop into eternal inconsequence
by the shading of a second, for there was
death in dusty Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s face. The escape
left Chadron shaken, like a man who has held himself
away from death by his finger-ends at the lip of
a ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed you&rsquo;d git me, Macdonald,&rdquo; Thorn repeated.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need no handcuffs nor nothin&rsquo;
for me. I&rsquo;ll go along with you as gentle as a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald indicated that Thorn might lower his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' ></a>117</span>
arms, having taken possession of the rifle. &ldquo;Have
you got a horse?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Thorn said that he had one in the hotel stable.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you try to take me too fur, Macdonald,&rdquo;
he advised. &ldquo;Chadron he&rsquo;ll ride a streak to git his
men together and try to take me away from you&mdash;I
could see it in his eye when he went out of that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald knew that Thorn had read Chadron&rsquo;s
intentions right. He nodded, to let him know that he
understood the cattleman&rsquo;s motives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you run me off to no private rope
party, neither, Macdonald, for I can tell you things
that many a man&rsquo;d pay me big money to keep my
mouth shut on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a chance, Thorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want it done in the right way, so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll git
the credit and the fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald was surprised to find this man, whose
infamous career had branded him as the arch-monster
of modern times, so vain and garrulous. He could
account for it by no other hypothesis than that much
killing had indurated the warped mind of the slayer
until the taking of a human life was to him a commonplace.
He was not capable of remorse, any more
than he had been disposed to pity. He was not a
man, only the blighted and cursed husk of a man,
indeed, but doubly dangerous for his irresponsibility,
for his atrophied small understanding.</p>
<p>Twenty miles lay between the prisoner and the
doubtful security of the jail at Meander, and most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' ></a>118</span>
of the distance was through the grazing lands within
Chadron&rsquo;s bounds. On the other hand, it was not
more than twelve miles to his ranch on the river. He
believed that he could reach it before Chadron could
raise men to stop him and take the prisoner away.</p>
<p>Once home with Thorn, he could raise a posse to
guard him until the sheriff could be summoned. Even
then there was no certainty that the prisoner ever
would see the inside of the Meander jail, for the
sheriff of that county was nothing more than one
of Chadron&rsquo;s cowboys, elevated to office to serve the
unrighteous desires of the men who had put him
there.</p>
<p>But Macdonald was determined that there should
be no private rope party for Thorn, neither at the
hands of the prisoner&rsquo;s employers nor at those of
the outraged settlers. Thorn must be brought to
trial publicly, and the story of his employment,
which he appeared ready enough to tell for the
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; in it, must be told in a manner that would
establish its value.</p>
<p>The cruelly inhuman tale of his contracts and
killings, his engagements and rewards, must be sown
by the newspapers far and wide. Out of this dark
phase of their oppression their deliverance must
rise.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>&ldquo;HELL&rsquo;S A-GOIN&rsquo; TO POP&rdquo;</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Chance Dalton, foreman of Alamito Ranch,
was in charge of the expedition that rode late
that afternoon against Macdonald&rsquo;s homestead to
liberate Mark Thorn, and close his mouth in the
cattlemen&rsquo;s effective way upon the bloody secrets
which he might in vainglorious boast reveal. Chadron
had promised rewards for the successful outcome
of the venture, and Chance Dalton rode with
his three picked men in a sportsman&rsquo;s heat.</p>
<p>He was going out on a hunt for game such as he
had run down more than once before in his many
years under Chadron&rsquo;s hand. It was better sport
than running down wolves or mountain lions, for
there was the superior intelligence of the game to
be considered. No man knew what turn the ingenuity
of desperation might give the human mind. The
hunted might go out in one last splendid blaze of
courage, or he might cringe and beg, with white face
and rolling eyes. In the case of Macdonald, Dalton
anticipated something unusual. He had tasted that
unaccountable homesteader&rsquo;s spirit in the past.</p>
<p>Dalton was a wiry, tough man who rode with his
elbows out, like an Indian. His face was scarred by
old knife-wounds, making it hard for him to shave,
in consequence of which he allowed his red beard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' ></a>120</span>
to grow to inch-length, where he kept it in subjugation
with shears. The gutters of his scars were
seen through it, and the ends of them ran up, on
both cheeks, to his eyes. A knife had gone across
one of these, missing the bright little pupil in its
bony cave, but slashing the eyebrow and leaving him
leering on that side.</p>
<p>The men who came behind him were cowboys from
the Texas Panhandle, lean and tough as the dried
beef of their native plains. It was the most formidable
force, not in numbers, but in proficiency, that
ever had proceeded against Macdonald, and the most
determined.</p>
<p>Chadron himself had bent to the small office of
spy to learn Macdonald&rsquo;s intention in reference to
his prisoner. From a sheltered thicket in the foothills
the cattleman had watched the homesteader
through his field glasses, making certain that he was
returning Thorn to the scene of his latest crimes,
instead of risking the long road to the Meander jail.</p>
<p>Chadron knew that Macdonald would defend the
prisoner&rsquo;s life with his own, even against his neighbors.
Macdonald would be as eager to have Thorn
tell the story of his transactions with the Drovers&rsquo;
Association as they would be to have it shut off. The
realization of this threw Chadron into a state which
he described to himself as the &ldquo;fantods.&rdquo; Another,
with a more extensive and less picturesque vocabulary,
would have said that the president of the Drovers&rsquo;
Association was in a condition of panic.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' ></a>121</span></div>
<p>So he had despatched his men on this silencing
errand, and now, as the sun was dipping over the
hills, all red with the presage of a frosty night,
Chance Dalton and his men came riding in sight of
Macdonald&rsquo;s little nest of buildings fronting the road
by the river.</p>
<p>Macdonald had secured his prisoner with ropes,
for there was no compartment in his little house, built
of boards from the mountain sawmill, strong enough
to confine a man, much less a slippery one like Mark
Thorn. The slayer had lapsed into his native taciturnity
shortly after beginning the trip from the
reservation to Macdonald&rsquo;s homestead, and now he
lay on the floor trussed up like a hog for market,
looking blackly at Macdonald. Macdonald was considering
the night ride to Meander with his prisoner
that he had planned, with the intention of proceeding
from there to Cheyenne and lodging him in jail.
He believed there might be a better chance of holding
him for trial there, and some slight hope of justice.</p>
<p>A hail from the gate startled Macdonald. It was
the custom of the homesteaders in that country,
carried with them from the hills of Missouri and
Arkansas, to sit in their saddles at a neighbor&rsquo;s gate
and call him to the door with a long &ldquo;hello-o-oh!&rdquo;
It was the password of friendship in that raw land;
a cowboy never had been known to stoop to its use.
Cowboys rode up to a homesteader&rsquo;s door when they
had anything to say to him, and hammered on it with
their guns.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' ></a>122</span></div>
<p>Macdonald went to the door and opened it unhesitatingly.
The horseman at the gate was a stranger
to him. He wore a little derby hat, such as the
cowpunchers despised, and the trappings of his horse
proclaimed him as a newcomer to that country. He
inquired loudly of the road to Fort Shakie, and Macdonald
shouted back the necessary directions, moving
a step away from his open door.</p>
<p>The stranger put his hand to his ear and leaned
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>At that sound of that distinctly-cowboy vernacular,
Macdonald sprang back to regain the shelter
of his walls, sensing too late the trap that the cowboy&rsquo;s
unguarded word had betrayed. Chance Dalton
at one corner of the rude bungalow, his next
best man at the other, had been waiting for the
decoy at the gate to draw Macdonald away from his
door. Now, as the homesteader leaped back in sudden
alarm, they closed in on him with their revolvers
drawn.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a third man trying the
back door at the same time, and the disguised cowboy
at the gate slung his weapon out and sent a
wild shot into the lintel above Macdonald&rsquo;s head.
The two of them on the ground had him at a disadvantage
which it would have been fatal to dispute,
and Macdonald, valuing a future chance more than a
present hopeless struggle, flung his hands out in a
gesture of emptiness and surrender.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' ></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em up&mdash;high!&rdquo; Dalton ordered.</p>
<p>Dalton watched him keenly as the three in that
picture before the door stood keyed to such tension
as the human intelligence seldom is called upon to
withstand. Macdonald stood with one foot on the
low threshold, the door swinging half open at his
back. He was bareheaded, his rough, fair hair in
wisps on temples and forehead. Dalton&rsquo;s teeth were
showing between his bearded lips, and his quick eyes
were scowling, but he held his companion back with
a command of his free hand.</p>
<p>Macdonald lifted his hands slowly, holding them
little above a level with his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up your prisoner, Macdonald, and we&rsquo;ll deal
square with you,&rdquo; Dalton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in and take him,&rdquo; offered Macdonald, stepping
aside out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead of us, and put &rsquo;em up higher!&rdquo; Dalton
made a little expressive flourish with his gun, evidently
distrustful of the homesteader&rsquo;s quick hand,
even at his present disadvantage.</p>
<p>The man at the back door was using the ax from
Macdonald&rsquo;s wood pile, as the sound of splintering
timber told. Between three fires, Macdonald felt his
chance stretching to the breaking point, for he had
no faith at all in Chance Dalton&rsquo;s word. They had
come to get him, and it looked now as if they had
won.</p>
<p>When Macdonald entered the house he saw Thorn
sitting in the middle of the floor, where he had rolled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' ></a>124</span>
and struggled in his efforts to see what was taking
place outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve played hell now, ain&rsquo;t you? lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em git
the drop on you that way!&rdquo; he said to Macdonald,
angrily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll swing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over that gun, Macdonald,&rdquo; Dalton demanded.
They were standing near him, one on either
hand, both leveling their guns at his head. Macdonald
could see the one at the back door of his little
two-roomed bungalow through the hole that he had
chopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hand my gun to any man; if you want
it, come and take it,&rdquo; Macdonald said, feeling that
the end was rushing upon him, and wondering what it
would be. A bullet was better than a rope, which
Chadron had publicly boasted he had laid up for
him. There was a long chance if Dalton reached
for that gun&mdash;a long and desperate chance.</p>
<p>The man at the back door was shouting something,
his gun thrust through the hole. Dalton made a
cross-reach with his left hand for Macdonald&rsquo;s revolver.
On the other side the cowboy was watching
his comrade&rsquo;s gun pointing through the kitchen door;
Macdonald could see the whites of his eyes as he
turned them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot in here! we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>His shifted eye told Macdonald that he was trusting
to Dalton, and Dalton at that moment was leaning
forward with a strain, cautiously, his hand near
Macdonald&rsquo;s holster.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' ></a>125</span></div>
<p>Macdonald brought his lifted arms down, like a
swimmer making a mighty stroke, with all the steam
behind them that he could raise. His back-handed
blow struck the cowboy in the face; Macdonald felt
the flame of his shot as it spurted past his forehead.
The other arm fell short of the nimbler and more
watchful Dalton, but the duck that he made to escape
it broke the drop that he had held over Macdonald.</p>
<p>Macdonald&rsquo;s hand flashed up with his own gun.
He drove a disabling shot through Dalton&rsquo;s wrist as
the ranch foreman was coming up to fire, and kicked
the gun that he dropped out of reach of his other
hand. The cowboy who had caught Macdonald&rsquo;s
desperate blow had staggered back against the foot
of the bed and fallen. Now he had regained himself,
and was crouching behind the bed, trying to cover
himself, and from there as he shrank down he fired.
The next flash he sprawled forward with hands outstretched
across the blanket, as if he had fallen on
his knees to pray.</p>
<p>Macdonald caught Dalton by the shirt collar as
he went scrambling on his knees after the revolver.
Dalton was splashing blood from his shattered wrist
over the room, but he was senseless to pain and blind
to danger. He sprang at Macdonald, cursing and
striking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off, Dalton! I don&rsquo;t want to kill you,
man!&rdquo; Macdonald warned.</p>
<p>Careless of his life Dalton fought, and as they
struggled Mark Thorn undoubled himself from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' ></a>126</span>
hunched position on the floor and snatched Dalton&rsquo;s
revolver in his bound hands from the floor. His long
legs free of his binding ropes, Thorn sprang for the
door. He reached it at the moment that the man in
the disguise of a homesteader pushed it open.</p>
<p>Macdonald did not see what took place there, for
it was over by the time he had struck Dalton into a
limp quiet heap at his feet by a blow with his revolver
across the eyes. But there had been a shot
at the door, and Macdonald had heard the man from
the back come running around the side of the house.
There were more shots, but all done before Macdonald
could leap to the door.</p>
<p>There, through the smoke of many quick shots
that drifted into the open door, he saw the two cowboys
fallen with outflung arms. In the road a few
rods distant Mark Thorn was mounting one of
Chadron&rsquo;s horses. The old outlaw flung himself flat
along the horse&rsquo;s neck, and presented little of his
vital parts as a target. As he galloped away Macdonald
fired, but apparently did not hit. In a
moment Thorn rode down the river-bank and out of
sight.</p>
<p>Macdonald stood a little while in the middle of the
disordered room after re-entering the house, a feeling
of great silence about him, and a numbness in his
ears and over his senses. It was a sensation such as
he had experienced once after standing for hours
under the spell of Niagara. Something seemed to
have been silenced in the world.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' ></a>127</span></div>
<p>He was troubled over the outcome of that treacherous
assault. He felt that the shadow of the resultant
tragedy was already stretching away from there
like the penumbra of an eclipse which must soon
engulf those homesteads on the river, and exact a
terrible, blasting toll.</p>
<p>Dalton was huddled there, his life wasting through
the wound in his wrist, blood on his face from the
blow that had laid him still. The dead man across
the bed remained as he had fallen, his arms stretched
out in empty supplication. There was a pathos in
the fellow&rsquo;s pose that touched Macdonald with a pity
which he knew to be undeserved. He had not meant
to take his life away in that hasty shot, but since it
had happened so, he knew that it had been his own
deliverance.</p>
<p>Macdonald stripped the garment back and looked
at Dalton&rsquo;s hurt. There would be another one to
take toll for in the cattlemen&rsquo;s list unless the drain
of blood could be checked at once. Dalton moved,
opening his eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed unlikely that Dalton ever would sling
a gun with that member again, if he should be so
lucky, indeed, as to come through with his life. The
bone was shattered, the hand hung limp, like a broken
wing. Dalton sat up, yielding his arm to his enemy&rsquo;s
ministrations, as silent and ungracious as a dog. In
a little while Macdonald had done all that he could
do, and with a hand under the hollow of Dalton&rsquo;s arm
he lifted him to his feet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' ></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ride?&rdquo; he asked. Dalton did not reply.
He looked at the figure on the bed, and stood turning
his eyes around the room in the manner of one
stunned, and completely confounded by the failure
of a scheme counted infallible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a botch of this job, Dalton,&rdquo; Macdonald
said. &ldquo;The rest of your crowd&rsquo;s outside
where Thorn dropped them&mdash;he snatched your gun
from the floor and killed both of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dalton went weakly to the door, where he stood a
moment, steadying himself with a hand on the jamb.
Macdonald eased him from there to the gate, and
brought the horses which the gang had hidden among
the willows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Chadron to send a wagon up here after these
dead men,&rdquo; Macdonald said, leading a horse to the
gate.</p>
<p>He helped the still silent Dalton into the saddle,
where he sat weakly. The man seemed to be debating
something to say to this unaccountably fortunate
nester, who came untouched through all their attempts
upon his life. But whatever it was that he
cogitated he kept to himself, only turning his eyes
back toward the house, where his two men lay on the
ground. The face of one was turned upward. In
the draining light of the spent day it looked as white
as innocence.</p>
<p>As Dalton drew his eyes away from the fearful
evidence of his plan&rsquo;s miscarriage, the sound of hard
riding came from the direction of the settlement up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' ></a>129</span>
the river. Macdonald listened a moment as the
sound grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be no friend of yours, Dalton. Get out
of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cut Dalton&rsquo;s horse a sharp blow. The beast
bounded away with a start that almost unseated its
dizzy rider; the two free animals galloped after it.
Chance Dalton was on his way to Chadron with his
burden of disgrace and disastrous news. It seemed
a question to Macdonald, as he watched him weaving
in the saddle as the gloom closed around him and shut
him from sight, whether he ever would reach the
ranchhouse to recount his story, whatever version of
the tragedy he had planned.</p>
<p>Tom Lassiter drew up before Macdonald&rsquo;s gate
while the dust of Dalton&rsquo;s going was still hanging
there. The gaunt old homesteader with the cloud
of sorrows in his eyes said that he had been on his
way over to see what had become of Macdonald in
his lone hunt for Mark Thorn. He had heard the
shooting, and the sound had hurried him forward.</p>
<p>Macdonald told him what had happened, and took
him in to see the wreckage left after that sudden
storm. Tom shook his head as he stood in the yard
looking down at the two dead men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to pop now!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve said the word, Tom,&rdquo; Macdonald
admitted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come back on me hard for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never have to stand up to &rsquo;em alone another
time, I&rsquo;ll give you a guarantee on that, Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' ></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; Macdonald replied, but
wearily, and with no warmth or faith in his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they let that old scorpeen loose to skulk
and kill ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure did oncork a hornet&rsquo;s nest when they
come here this time, though, they sure did!&rdquo; Tom
stood in the door, looking into the darkening room
and at the figure sprawled across the bed. &ldquo;He-ell&rsquo;s
a-goin&rsquo; to pop now!&rdquo; he said again, in slow words
scarcely above his breath.</p>
<p>He turned his head searchingly, as if he expected
to see the cloud of it already lowering out of the
night.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE SE&Ntilde;OR BOSS COMES RIDING</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nola Chadron had been a guest overnight at
the post. She had come the afternoon before,
bright as a bubble, and Frances had met her with a
welcome as warm as if there never had been a shadow
between them.</p>
<p>Women can do such things so much better than
men. Balzac said they could murder under the cover
of a kiss. Perhaps somebody else said it ahead of
him; certainly a great many of us have thought it
after. There is not one out of the whole world of
them but is capable of covering the fire of lies in her
heart with the rose leaves of her smiles.</p>
<p>Nola had come into Frances&rsquo; room to do her hair,
and employ her busy tongue while she plied the brush.
She was a pretty bit of a figure in her fancily-worked
Japanese kimono and red Turkish slippers&mdash;harem
slippers, she called them, and thought it deliciously
wicked to wear them&mdash;as she sat shaking back her
bright hair like a giver of sunbeams.</p>
<p>Frances, already dressed in her soft light apparel
of the morning, stood at the window watching the
activity of the avenue below, answering encouragingly
now and then, laughing at the right time, to
keep the stream of her little guest&rsquo;s words running
on. Frances seemed all softness and warmth, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' ></a>132</span>
youth and freshness, as fair as a camellia in a sunny
casement, there at the window with the light around
her. Above that inborn dignity which every line of
her body expressed, there was a domestic tranquillity
in her subdued beauty that moved even irresponsible
Nola with an admiration that she could not put into
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you soldiers!&rdquo; said Nola, shaking her brush
at Frances&rsquo; placid back, &ldquo;you get up so early and
you dress so fast that you&rsquo;re always ahead of everybody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances turned to her, a smile for her childish
complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get into our soldiering ways in time,
Nola. We get up early and live in a hurry, I suppose,
because a soldier&rsquo;s life is traditionally uncertain,
and he wants to make the most of his time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And love and ride away,&rdquo; said Nola, feigning a
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; asked Frances, not interested, turning
to the window again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Nola, positively.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Like the guardsmen of old England,</p>
<p>Or the beaux sabreurs of France&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>that&rsquo;s an old border song, did you ever hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the Texas rangers, though, and not
real soldiers like you folks. A cavalryman&rsquo;s wife
wrote it; I&rsquo;ve got it in a book.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' ></a>133</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they do that way in Texas, Nola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love and ride away, as you said. I never heard
of any of them doing it, except figuratively, in the
regular army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola suspended her brushing and looked at
Frances curiously, a deeper color rising and spreading
in her animated face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you little goose!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly they hang around and make trouble for
people and fools of themselves,&rdquo; said Frances, in
half-thoughtful vein, her back to her visitor, who
had stopped brushing now, and was winding, a comb
in her mouth.</p>
<p>Nola held her quick hand at the half-finished coil
of hair while she looked narrowly at the outline of
Frances&rsquo; form against the window. A little squint
of perplexity was in her eyes, and furrows in her
smooth forehead. Presently she finished the coil with
dextrous turn, and held it with outspread hand while
she reached to secure it with the comb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you out sometimes, Frances, you&rsquo;re
so funny,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to talk to you
half the time&rdquo;&mdash;which was in no part true&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re
so nunnish and severe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Frances, fully discounting the declaration.</p>
<p>No wonder that Major King was hard to wean
from her, thought Nola, with all that grace of body
and charm of word. Superiority had been born in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' ></a>134</span>
Frances Landcraft, not educated into her in expensive
schools, the cattleman&rsquo;s daughter knew. It
spoke for itself in the carriage of her head there
against the light of that fair new day, with the sunshine
on the dying cottonwood leaves beyond the
windowpane; in the lifting of her neck, white as King
David&rsquo;s tower of shields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> half afraid of you sometimes,&rdquo; Nola
persisted. &ldquo;I draw my hand back from touching you
when you&rsquo;ve got one of your soaring fits on you and
walk along like you couldn&rsquo;t see common mortals and
cowmen&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, everybody isn&rsquo;t like you, Nola; there are
some who treat me like a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was thinking of her father and Major
King, both of whom had continued to overlook and
ignore her declaration of severance from her plighted
word. The colonel had brushed it aside with rough
hand and sharp word; the major had come penitent
and in suppliance. But both of them were determined
to marry her according to schedule, with no weight
to her solemn denial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mothers do that, right along,&rdquo; Nola nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody else up early&rdquo;&mdash;Frances held
the curtain aside as she spoke, and leaned a little to
see&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s your father, just turning in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;or boss?&rdquo; said Nola, hurrying to the
window.</p>
<p>Saul Chadron was mounting the steps booted and
dusty, his revolvers belted over his coat. &ldquo;I wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' ></a>135</span>
what&rsquo;s the matter? I hope it isn&rsquo;t mother&mdash;I&rsquo;ll run
down and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid had let Chadron in by the time Nola
opened the door of the room, and there she stood
leaning and listening, her little head out in the hall,
as if afraid to run to meet trouble. Chadron&rsquo;s big
voice came up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Nola nodded to Frances, who
stood at her elbow, &ldquo;he wants to see the colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances had heard the cattleman&rsquo;s loud demand
for instant audience. Now the maid was explaining
in temporizing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel he&rsquo;s busy with military matters this
early in the day, sir, and nobody ever disturbs him.
He don&rsquo;t see nobody but the officers. If you&rsquo;ll step
in and wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officers can wait!&rdquo; Chadron said, in loud,
assertive voice that made the servant shiver.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances could see in her lively imagination the
frightened maid&rsquo;s gesture toward the colonel&rsquo;s office
door. Now the girl&rsquo;s feet sounded along the hall in
hasty retreat as Chadron laid his hearty knock
against the colonel&rsquo;s panels.</p>
<p>Frances smiled behind her friend&rsquo;s back. The impatient
disregard by civilians of the forms which her
father held in such esteem always was a matter of
humor to her. She expected now to hear explosions
from within her father&rsquo;s sacred place, and when the
sound failed to reach her she concluded that some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' ></a>136</span>
subordinate hand had opened the door to Chadron&rsquo;s
summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry&rdquo;&mdash;Nola dashed into her own room,
finishing from the door&mdash;&ldquo;I want to catch him before
he goes and find out what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances went below to see about breakfast for
her tardy guest, a little fluttering of excitement in
her own breast. She wondered what could have
brought the cattleman to the post so early&mdash;he
must have left long before dawn&mdash;and in such haste
to see her father, all buckled about with his arms.
She trusted that it might not be that Alan Macdonald
was involved in it, for it was her constant
thought to hope well for that bold young man who
had heaved the homesteaders&rsquo; world to his shoulders
and stood straining, untrusted and uncheered, under
its weight.</p>
<p>True, he had not died in defense of her glove, but
she had forgiven him in her heart for that. A reasonable
man would not have imperiled his life for
such a trifle, and a reasonable woman would not have
expected it. There was a great deal more sense in
Alan Macdonald living for his life&rsquo;s purpose than in
dying for a foolish little glove. So she said.</p>
<p>The white gossamer fichu about her throat moved
as with a breath in the agitation of her bosom as
she passed down the stairs; her imperious chin was
lowered, and her strong brown eyes were bent like
a nun&rsquo;s before the altar. Worthy or unworthy, her
lips moved in a prayer for Alan Macdonald, strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' ></a>137</span>
man in his obscure place; worthy or unworthy, she
wished him well, and her heart yearned after him
with a great tenderness, like a south wind roaming the
night in gentle quest.</p>
<p>Major King, in attendance upon his chief, had
opened the door to Saul Chadron at the colonel&rsquo;s
frowning nod. Without waiting for the password
into the mysteries of that chamber, Chadron had
entered, his heavy quirt in hand, gauntlets to his
elbows, dusty boots to his knees. Colonel Landcraft
stood at his desk to receive him, his brows bent in a
disfavoring frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve busted in on you, colonel, because my business
is business, not a mess of reportin&rsquo; and signin&rsquo;
up on nothing, like your fool army doin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Chadron
clamped with clicking spurs across the severe
bare floor as he made this announcement, the frown
of his displeasure in having been stopped at the door
still dark on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting your pleasure, sir,&rdquo; Colonel Landcraft
returned, stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want twenty-five troopers and a cannon, and
somebody that knows how to use it, and I want &rsquo;em
right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron gave the order with a hotness about him,
and an impatience not to be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Colonel Landcraft, throwing his bony
shoulders back, his little blue eyes growing very cold
and unfriendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them damn rustlers of Macdonald&rsquo;s are up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' ></a>138</span>
standin&rsquo; agin us, and I tell you I want troopers,
and I want &rsquo;em on the spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft swallowed like an eagle gorging
a fish. His face grew red, he clamped his jaw, and
held his mouth shut. It took him some little time
to suppress his flooding emotions, and his voice trembled
even when he ventured to trust himself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter for your civil authorities, sir;
I have nothing to do with it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got&mdash;nothing&mdash;?&rdquo; Chadron&rsquo;s amazement
seemed to overcome him. He stopped, his eyes
big, his mouth open; he turned his head from side to
side in dumbfounded way, as if to find another to bear
witness to this incredible thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you they&rsquo;re threatenin&rsquo; my property, and
the property of my neighbors!&rdquo; protested Chadron,
stunned, it seemed, that he should have to stop for
details and explanations. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got millions invested&mdash;if
them fellers gobbles up our land we&rsquo;re
ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I can sympathize with you in your unfortunate
business, but if I had millions of my own at stake
under similar conditions I would be powerless to employ,
on my own initiative, the forces of the United
States army to drive those brigands away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron looked at him hard, his hat on his head,
where it had remained all the time, his eyes staring in
unspeakable surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell you would!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your neighbors surely can raise enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' ></a>139</span>
men to crush the scoundrels, and hang their leader to
a limb,&rdquo; the colonel suggested. &ldquo;Call out your men,
Chadron, and ride against him. I never took you for
a man to squeal for help in a little affair like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got as many as a hundred men organized,
maybe twice that&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron multiplied on the
basis of damage that his men had suffered&mdash;&ldquo;and
my men tell me he&rsquo;s drillin&rsquo; &rsquo;em like soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised to hear that,&rdquo; nodded the
colonel; &ldquo;that man Macdonald&rsquo;s got it in him to do
that, and fight like the devil, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gang of &rsquo;em killed three of my men a couple
of days ago when I sent &rsquo;em up there to his shack to
investigate a little matter, and Macdonald shot my
foreman up so bad I guess he&rsquo;ll die. I tell you, man,
it&rsquo;s a case for troopers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the sheriff and the rest of you done
to restore order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took twenty of my men up there yisterday, and
a bunch of Sam Hatcher&rsquo;s from acrosst the river was
to join us and smoke that wolf out of his hole and
hang his damn hide on his cussed bob-wire fence. But
hell! they was ditched in around that shack of his&rsquo;n,
I tell you, gentlemen, and he peppered us so hard
we had to streak out of there. I left two of my men,
and Hatcher&rsquo;s crew couldn&rsquo;t come over to help us,
for them damn rustlers had breastworks throwed up
over there and drove &rsquo;em away from the river.
They&rsquo;ve got us shut out from the only ford in thirty
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' ></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; said the colonel, warming
at this warlike news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald&rsquo;s had the gall to send me notice to
keep out of that country up the river, and to run
my cattle out of there, and it&rsquo;s my own land, by
God! I&rsquo;ve been grazin&rsquo; it for eighteen years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a serious situation,&rdquo; the colonel admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious!&rdquo; There was scorn for the word and its
weakness in Chadron&rsquo;s stress. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell, I tell you,
when a man can&rsquo;t set foot on his own land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they all rustlers up there in the settlement?
are there no honest homesteaders among them who
would combine with you against this wild man and
his unlawful followers?&rdquo; the colonel wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a man amongst &rsquo;em that ain&rsquo;t cut the brand
out of a hide,&rdquo; Chadron declared. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been
nestin&rsquo; up there under that man Macdonald for the
last two years, and he&rsquo;s the brains of the pack. He
gits his rake-off out of all they run off and sell. Me
and the other cattlemen we&rsquo;ve been feedin&rsquo; and supportin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em till the drain&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n we can
stand. We&rsquo;ve got to put &rsquo;em out, like a fire, or be
eat up. We&rsquo;ve got to hit &rsquo;em, and hit &rsquo;em hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; the colonel agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a state of war, I tell you, colonel; you&rsquo;re
free to use your troops in a state of war, ain&rsquo;t you?
Twenty-five troopers, with a little small cannon&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron
made illustration of the caliber that he considered
adequate for the business with his hands&mdash;&ldquo;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' ></a>141</span>
knock &rsquo;em out of their ditches so we could pick
&rsquo;em off as they scatter, would be enough; we can handle
the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is anything that I can do for you in my
private capacity, I am at your command,&rdquo; offered
Colonel Landcraft, with official emptiness, &ldquo;but I
regret that I am powerless to grant your request for
troops. I couldn&rsquo;t lift a finger in a matter like this
without a department order; you ought to understand
that, Chadron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s bitin&rsquo; you, go ahead&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
take care of the department,&rdquo; Chadron told him, with
the relieved manner of one who had seen a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Chadron had proposed treason the colonel could
not have compressed more censure into that word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Chadron assured him, comfortably;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two senators and five congressmen
back there in Washington that jigger when I
jerk the gee-string. You can cut loose and come into
this thing with a free hand, and go the limit, the
department be damned if they don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft&rsquo;s face was flaming angrily. He
snapped his dry old eyelids like flints over the steel
of his eyes, and stood as straight as the human body
could be drawn, one hand on his sword hilt, the other
pointing a trembling finger at Chadron&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cattlemen run this state, and one or two
others here in the Northwest, I&rsquo;m aware of that,
Chadron. But there&rsquo;s one thing that you don&rsquo;t run,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' ></a>142</span>
and that&rsquo;s the United States army! I don&rsquo;t care a
damn how many congressmen dance to your tune,
you&rsquo;re not big enough to move even one trooper out
of my barracks, sir! That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron stood a little while, glowering at the
colonel. It enraged him to be blocked in that manner
by a small and inconsequential man. This he felt
Colonel Landcraft to be, measured against his own
strength and importance in that country. Himself
and the other two big cattlemen in that section of the
state lorded it over an area greater than two or three
of the old states where the slipping heritage of individual
liberty was born. Now here was a colonel
in his way; one little old gray colonel!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Chadron said at length, charging his
words with what he doubtless meant to be a significant
foreboding, measuring Colonel Landcraft with
contemptuous eye. &ldquo;I can call out an army of my
own. I came to you because we pay you fellers to
do what I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; of you, and because I thought it&rsquo;d
save me time. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came to me because you have magnified your
importance in this country until you believe you&rsquo;re
the entire nation,&rdquo; the colonel replied, very hot and
red.</p>
<p>Chadron made no answer to that. He turned
toward the military door, but Colonel Landcraft
would not permit his unsanctified feet, great as they
were and free to come and go as they liked in other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' ></a>143</span>
places, to pass that way. He frowned at Major
King, who had stood by in silence all the time, like
a good soldier, his eyes straight ahead. Major King
touched Chadron&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, sir, if you please,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chadron started out, wrathfully and noisily. Half-way
to the door he turned, his dark face sneering in
contemptuous scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re one hell of a colonel!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Major King was holding the door open; Chadron
swung his big body around to face it, and passed out.
Major King saluted his superior officer and followed
the cattleman into the hall, closing the sacred door
behind him on the wrathful little old soldier standing
beside his desk. King extended his hand, sympathy
in gesture and look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was in command of this post, sir, you&rsquo;d never
have to ask twice for troops,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s sudden interest seemed to give him the
movement of a little start. His grip on the young
officer&rsquo;s hand tightened as he bent a searching look
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King, I believe you!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nola came pattering down the stairs. Chadron
stood with open arms, and swallowed her in them as
she leaped from the bottom tread. Major King did
not wait to see her emerge again, rosy and lip-tempting.
There was unfinished business within the
colonel&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Nola, excited to her finger-ends,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' ></a>144</span>
was retailing the story of the rustlers&rsquo; uprising
to Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s all worked up over it; she&rsquo;s afraid
they&rsquo;ll burn us out and murder us, but of course we&rsquo;d
clean them up before they&rsquo;d ever get <i>that</i> far down
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me like a very serious situation for
everybody concerned,&rdquo; Frances said. &ldquo;If your
father brings in the men that you say he&rsquo;s gone to
Meander to telegraph for, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot
of killing done on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father says he&rsquo;s going to clean them out for
good this time&mdash;they&rsquo;ve cost us thousands of dollars
in the past three years. Oh, you can&rsquo;t understand
what a low-down bunch of scrubs those rustlers are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Frances said, giving it up with a
little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go back to mother this morning, right
away, but that little fuss up the river doesn&rsquo;t need
to keep you from going home with me as you promised,
Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind, but I don&rsquo;t believe father will
want me to go out into your wild country. I really
want to go&mdash;I want to look around in your garden
for a glove that I lost there on the night of the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Nola&rsquo;s face seemed
to clear of something, a shadow of perplexity, it
seemed, that Frances had seen in it from time to
time since her coming there. She looked frankly and
reprovingly at Frances.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' ></a>145</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t miss it until I was leaving, and I didn&rsquo;t
want to delay the rest of them to look for it. It
really doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder mother didn&rsquo;t find it; she&rsquo;s always
prowling around among the flowers,&rdquo; said Nola, her
eyes fixed in abstracted stare, as if she was thinking
deeply of something apart from what her words expressed.</p>
<p>What she was considering, indeed, was that her
little scheme of alienation had failed. Major King,
she told herself, had not returned the glove to
Frances. For all his lightness in the matter, perhaps
he cared deeply for Frances, and would be more difficult
to wean than she had thought. It would have
to be begun anew. That Frances was ignorant of
her treachery, as she now fully believed, made it
easier. So the little lady told herself, surveying the
situation in her quick brain, and deceiving herself
completely, as many a shrewder schemer than she,
when self-entangled in the devious plottings of this
life.</p>
<p>On the other hand there sat Frances across the
table&mdash;they were breakfasting alone, Mrs. Landcraft
being a strict militarist, and always serving the
colonel&rsquo;s coffee with her own hand&mdash;throwing up a
framework of speculation on her own account. Perhaps
if she should go to the ranch she might be in
some manner instrumental in bringing this needless
warfare to a pacific end. Intervention at the right
time, in the proper quarter, might accomplish more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' ></a>146</span>
than strife and bloodshed could bring out of that
one-sided war.</p>
<p>No matter for the justice of the homesteaders&rsquo;
cause, and the sincerity of their leader, neither of
which she doubted or questioned, the weight of numbers
and resources would be on the side of the cattlemen.
It could result only in the homesteaders being
driven from their insecure holdings after the sacrifice
of many lives. If she could see Macdonald, and
appeal to him to put down this foolish, even though
well-intended strife, something might result.</p>
<p>It was an inconsequential turmoil, it seemed to
her, there in that sequestered land, for a man like
Alan Macdonald to squander his life upon. If he
stood against the forces which Chadron had gone to
summon, he would be slain, and the abundant promise
of his life wasted like water on the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, Nola,&rdquo; she said, rising from
the table in quick decision.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_RUSTLERS'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>&ldquo;THE RUSTLERS!&rdquo;</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood up for that man, and I&rsquo;ve stood by
him,&rdquo; said Banjo Gibson, &ldquo;but when a man
shoots a friend of my friend he ain&rsquo;t no friend of
mine. I&rsquo;m done with him; I won&rsquo;t never set a boot-heel
inside of his door ag&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo was in Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s south sitting-room,
with its friendly fireplace and homely things, including
Mrs. Chadron and her apparently interminable
sock. Only now it was a gray sock, designed not
for the mighty foot of Saul, but for Chance Dalton,
lying on his back in the bunkhouse in a fever growing
out of the handling that he had gone through at
Macdonald&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Banjo had arrived at the ranch the previous evening.
He was sitting now with his fiddle on his
knee, having gone through the repertory most
favored by his hostess, with the exception of &ldquo;Silver
Threads.&rdquo; That was an afternoon melody, Banjo
maintained, and one would have strained his friendship
and shaken his respect if he had insisted upon
the musician putting bow to it in the morning hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Chadron, &ldquo;it was bad enough
when he just shot cowboys, but when it come to
Chance we felt real grieved. Chance he ain&rsquo;t much to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' ></a>148</span>
look at, but he&rsquo;s worth his weight in gold on the
ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busted his right arm all to pieces, they tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here.&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron marked across her
wrist with her knitting needle, and shook her head
in heavy sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll kind of spile him, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Saul says it won&rsquo;t make so much difference
about him not havin&rsquo; the use of his hand on that side
if it don&rsquo;t break his nerve. A man loses confidence
in himself, Saul says, most always when he loses the
hand or arm he&rsquo;s slung his gun with all his life. He
takes the notion that everybody&rsquo;s quicker&rsquo;n he is,
and just kind of slinges back and drops out of the
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect Saul he&rsquo;ll come back here with
them soldiers he went after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;ll more&rsquo;n likely order &rsquo;em right up
the river to clear them rustlers out before he stops
or anything,&rdquo; she replied, in high confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gall of them low-down brand-burners standin&rsquo;
up to fight a man on his own land!&rdquo; Banjo&rsquo;s indignation
could not have been more pointed if he had
been a lord of many herds himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes them blessed girls!&rdquo; reported Mrs.
Chadron from her station near the window. Banjo
crossed over to see, his fiddle held to his bosom like
an infant. Nola and Frances were nearing the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That colonel girl she&rsquo;s a up-setter, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
Banjo admired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' ></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as sweet as locus&rsquo; blooms,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron
declared, unstintingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s kind of distant; nothing friendly and
warm-hearted like your little Nola, mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little cool to strangers, but when she
knows a body she comes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo nodded, drawing little whispers of melody
from his fiddle-strings by fingering them against the
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed when she smiles she seems to change,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like puttin&rsquo; bow to the strings. A
fiddle&rsquo;s a glum kind of a thing till you wake it up;
she&rsquo;s that way, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, git ready for dinner&mdash;or lunch, as Nola
calls it&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be starved by this time, ridin&rsquo;
all the way from the post in this chilly wind. I&rsquo;m
mighty afraid we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have some weather before
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t put it off much longer,&rdquo; Banjo agreed,
thinking of the hardship of being caught out in one
of those sweeping blizzards, when the sudden cold
grew so sharp that a man&rsquo;s banjo strings broke in
the tense contraction. That had happened to him
more than once, and it only seemed to sharpen the
pleasure of being snowed in at a place like Alamito,
where the kitchen was fat and the hand of the host
free. He smiled as he turned to the kitchen to wash
his face and soap his hair.</p>
<p>They passed a very pleasant afternoon at the
ranchhouse, in spite of Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s uneasiness on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' ></a>150</span>
account of their defenseless state. At that season
Chadron and his neighbors could not draw very
heavily on their scattered forces following the divided
herds spread out over the vast territory for the
winter grazing.</p>
<p>The twenty men gathered in a hurry-call by
Chadron to avenge the defeat of Chance Dalton,
who had in their turn been met and unexpectedly repulsed
by the homesteaders, as Chadron had related
in his own way to Colonel Landcraft, were lying in
camp several miles up the river. That is, all that
were left of them fit for duty after the fight. A
good many of them were limping, and would limp for
many a day.</p>
<p>They were waiting the arrival of the troops, which
they expected with the same confidence Mrs. Chadron
had held before Nola brought her an explanation that
covered the confusion of refusal.</p>
<p>Neither of the young women knew of the tiff between
the colonel and Chadron, for the colonel was a
man who kept his family apart from his business.
Chadron had not seen fit to uncover his humiliation to
his daughter, but had told her that he was acting on
the advice of Colonel Landcraft in sending to his
friends in Cheyenne for men to put down the uprising
of rustlers himself.</p>
<p>So there were comfortable enough relations between
them all at the ranch as the day bent to evening and
the red sunset changed to gray. Banjo played for
them, as he had done that other afternoon, and sang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' ></a>151</span>
his sentimental songs in voice that quavered in the
feeling passages. Chadron had not left anybody to
guard the house, because he knew very well that
Macdonald considered nothing beyond defense, and
that he would as quickly burn his own mother&rsquo;s
roof above her head as he would set torch to that
home by the riverside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing us that dreamy one, Banjo,&rdquo; Nola requested,
&ldquo;the one that begins &lsquo;Come sit by my side
little&mdash;&rsquo; you know the one I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sentimental tenderness came into Banjo&rsquo;s face.
He turned his head so that he could look out of the
window into the thickening landscape beyond the
corral gate, gray and mysterious and unfriendly now
as a twilight sea. Nola touched Frances&rsquo; arm to
prime her for the treat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch his face,&rdquo; she whispered, smiling behind
her hand.</p>
<p>Banjo struck the chords of his accompaniment;
the sentimental cast of his face deepened, until it
seemed that he was about to come to tears. He sang:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Come sit by my side litt-ul dau-ling,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And lay your brown head on my breast,</p>
<p>Whilse the angels of twilight o-round us</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Are singing the flow-ohs to rest.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>Banjo must have loved many ladies in many lands,
for that is the gift and the privilege of the troubadour.
Now he seemed calling up their vanished faces
out of the twilight as he sang his little song. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' ></a>152</span>
feeling he threw into the chorus, what shaking of
the voice, what soft sinking away of the last notes,
the whang of the banjo softened by palm across the
strings!</p>
<p>The chorus:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>O, what can be sweet-o than dreaming</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Tho dream that is on us tonight!</p>
<p>Pre-haps do you know litt-ul dau-ling,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Tho future lies hidded from sight.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>There was a great deal more of that song, which
really was not so bad, the way Banjo sang it, for
he exalted it on the best qualities that lived in his
harmless breast; not so bad that way, indeed, as it
looks in print. Frances could not see where the joke
at the little musician&rsquo;s expense came in, although
Nola was laughing behind his unsuspecting back as
the last notes died.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron wiped her eyes. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the
sweetest song that ever was sung!&rdquo; she said, and
meant it, every word.</p>
<p>Banjo said nothing at all, but put away his instrument
with reverent hands, as if no sound was worthy
to come out of it after that sweet agony of love.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron got up, in her large, bustling, hospitable
way, sentimentally satisfied, and withal
grossly hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;ll be about ready now, children,&rdquo; she
said, putting her sock away in its basket, &ldquo;and
while you two are primpin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll run down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' ></a>153</span>
bunkhouse and take some chicken broth to Chance
that Maggie made him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor old Chance!&rdquo; Nola pitied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
sitting here enjoying myself and forgetting all about
him. I&rsquo;ll take it down to him, mother&mdash;Banjo he&rsquo;ll
come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo was alert on the proposal, and keen to go.
He brought Nola&rsquo;s coat at her mother&rsquo;s suggestion,
for the evening had a feeling of frost in it, and attended
her to the kitchen after the chicken broth as
gallantly as if he wore a sword.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron came back from her investigations
in the kitchen in a little while to Frances, who waited
alone before the happy little fire in the chimney. She
sighed as she resumed her rocking-chair by the window,
and crossed her seldom idle hands over her
comfortably inelegant front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be some little time before supper&rsquo;s ready to
set down to,&rdquo; she announced regretfully. &ldquo;Maggie&rsquo;s
makin&rsquo; stuffed peppers, and they&rsquo;re kind of slow to
bake. We can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Frances agreed, her mind running
on the hope that had brought her to the ranch; the
hope of seeing Macdonald, and appealing to him in
pity&rsquo;s name for peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thievin&rsquo; Macdonald&rsquo;s to blame for Chance,
our foreman, losin&rsquo; the use of his right hand,&rdquo; Mrs.
Chadron said, with asperity. &ldquo;Did Nola tell you
about the fight they had with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she told me about it as we came.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' ></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like the devil&rsquo;s harnessed up with that
man, he does so much damage without ever gittin&rsquo;
hurt himself. He had a crowd of rustlers up there
with him when Chance went up there to trace some
stock, and they up and killed three of our cowboys.
Ain&rsquo;t it terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is terrible!&rdquo; Frances shuddered, withholding
her opinion on which side the terror lay, together
with the blame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Saul went up there with some more of the
men to burn that Macdonald&rsquo;s shack and drive him
off of our land, and they run into a bunch of them
rustlers that Macdonald he&rsquo;d fetched over there, and
two more of our men was killed. It looks like a
body&rsquo;s got to fight night and day for his rights now,
since them nesters begun to come in here. Well, we
was here first, and Saul says we&rsquo;ll be here last. But
I think it&rsquo;s plumb scan&rsquo;lous the way them rustlers
bunches together and fights. They never was known
to do it before, and they wouldn&rsquo;t do it now if it
wasn&rsquo;t for that black-hearted thief, Macdonald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see him?&rdquo; Frances asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did, and don&rsquo;t never want to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just asked you because he doesn&rsquo;t look like a
bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he sneaked in here the night of Nola&rsquo;s
dance, but I didn&rsquo;t see him. Oh, what &rsquo;m I tellin&rsquo;
you? Course you know <i>that</i>&mdash;you danced with
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frances, neither sorry nor ashamed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' ></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you wasn&rsquo;t to blame, honey,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron
comforted, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t know him from Adamses
off ox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances sat leaning forward, looking into the fire.
The light of the blaze was on her face, appealingly
soft and girlishly sweet. Mrs. Chadron laid a hand
on her hair in motherly caress, moved by a tenderness
quite foreign to the vindictive creed which she
had pronounced against the nesters but a little while
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re starved, honey,&rdquo; she said, in
genuine solicitude, thus expressing the nearest human
sympathy out of her full-feeding soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, but far from starving,&rdquo; Frances
told her, knowing that the confession to an appetite
would please her hostess better than a gift. &ldquo;When
do you expect Mr. Chadron home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, honey, but you don&rsquo;t need to
worry; them rustlers can&rsquo;t pass our men Saul left
camped up the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that; I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron chuckled. &ldquo;Did I tell you about
Nola?&rdquo; she asked. Then, answering herself, before
Frances could more than turn her head inquiringly;
&ldquo;No, of course, I never. It was too funny for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Frances asked, in girlish eagerness.
Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s smile was reflected in her face
as she sat straight, and turned expectantly to her
hostess.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' ></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The other evening when she and her father was
comin&rsquo; home from the postoffice over at the agency
they run acrosst that sneak Macdonald, afoot in the
road, guns so thick on him you couldn&rsquo;t count &rsquo;em.
Saul asked him what he was skulkin&rsquo; around down
this way for, and the feller he was kind of sassy
about it, and tried to pass Nola and go on. He had
the gall to tip his hat to her, just like she was low
enough to notice a brand-burner! Well, she give
him a larrup over the face with her whip that cut
the hide! He took hold of her bridle to shove her
horse out of the way so he could run, I reckon, and
she switched him till he squirmed like a puppy-dog!
I laughed till I nearly split when Saul told me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron surrendered again to her keen appreciation
of the humor in that situation. Frances
felt now that she understood the attitude of the cattlemen
toward the homesteaders as she never had
even sensed it before. Here was this motherly
woman, naturally good at heart and gentle, hardened
and blinded by her prejudices until she could discuss
murder as a thing desired, and the extirpation
of a whole community as a just and righteous deed.</p>
<p>There was no feeling of softness in her breast for
the manful strivings of Alan Macdonald to make
a home in that land, not so much for himself&mdash;for it
was plain that he would grace a different world to
far better advantage&mdash;but for the disinherited of
the earth. To Mrs. Chadron he was a thing apart
from her species, a horrible, low, grisly monster, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' ></a>157</span>
whom the earth should afford no refuge and man
no hiding-place. There was no virtue in Alan
Macdonald; his fences had killed his right to human
consideration.</p>
<p>In a moment Mrs. Chadron was grave again. She
put out her hand in that gentle, motherly way and
touched Frances&rsquo; hair, smoothing it from her forehead,
pleased with the irrepressible life of it which
sprung it back after the passage of her palm like
water in a vessel&rsquo;s wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let on to you a little while ago that I wasn&rsquo;t
uneasy, honey,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t no hand at
hidin&rsquo; the truth. I am uneasy, honey, and on pins,
for I don&rsquo;t trust them rustlers. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll
hear that Saul&rsquo;s gone, and come sneakin&rsquo; down here
and burn us out before morning, and do worse, maybe.
I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;ve got that feelin&rsquo;, but I have, and
it&rsquo;s heavy in me, like raw dough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d do anything like that,&rdquo;
Frances told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know &rsquo;em like we do, honey, the
low-down thieves! They ort to be hunted like wolves
and shot, wherever they&rsquo;re found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them have wives and children, haven&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; Frances asked, thinking aloud, as she sat
with her chin resting in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose they litter like any other wolves,&rdquo;
Mrs. Chadron returned, unfeelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si a tu ventana llega una paloma</i>,&rdquo; sang Maggie
in the kitchen, the snapping of the oven door coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' ></a>158</span>
in quite harmoniously as she closed it on the baking
peppers. Mrs. Chadron sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tratala con cari&ntilde;a que es mi persona</i>,&rdquo; sounded
Maggie, a degree louder. Mrs. Chadron sat upright,
with a new interest in life apart from her uneasy
forebodings about the rustlers. Maggie was in the
dining-room, spreading the cloth. The peppers were
coming along.</p>
<p>Somebody burst into the kitchen; uncertain feet
came across it; a cry broke Maggie&rsquo;s song short as
she jingled the silver in place on the cloth. Banjo
Gibson stumbled into the room where the low fire
twinkled in the chimney, reeling on his legs, his
breath coming in groans.</p>
<p>Maggie was behind him, holding the door open;
the light from the big lamp on the dining-table fell
on the musician, who weaved there as if he might
fall. His hat was off, blood was in his eyes and over
his face from a wound at the edge of his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nola&mdash;Nola!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron, already beside him, laid hold of him
now and shook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it, you little devil&mdash;tell it!&rdquo; she screamed.</p>
<p>Frances, with gentler hand, drew Banjo from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to Nola?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rustlers!&rdquo; he said, his voice falling away in
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rustlers!&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron groaned, her arms
lifted above her head. She ran in wild distraction
into the dining-room, now back to the chimney to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' ></a>159</span>
take down a rifle that hung in its case on a deer prong
over the mantel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nola, Nola!&rdquo; she called, running out into the
garden. Her wild voice came back from there in a
moment, crying her daughter&rsquo;s name in agony.</p>
<p>Banjo had sunk to the floor, his battered face held
in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! they took her!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;The
rustlers, they took her, and I couldn&rsquo;t lift a hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances beckoned to Maggie, who had followed her
mistress to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him water; stop the blood,&rdquo; she ordered
sharply.</p>
<p>In a moment she had dashed out after Mrs.
Chadron, and was running frantically along the
garden path toward the river.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE TRAIL AT DAWN</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Frances stopped at the high wire fence along
the river bank. It was dark there between the
shrubs of the garden on one hand and the tall willows
on the other, but nothing moved in them but her own
leaping heart. She called Mrs. Chadron, running
along the fence as she cried her name.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron answered from the barn. Frances
found her saddling a horse, while Maggie&rsquo;s husband,
an old Mexican with a stiff leg, muttered prayers in
his native tongue as he tightened the girths on another.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was for riding in pursuit of Nola&rsquo;s
abductors, although she had not mounted a horse in
fifteen years. There was no man about the place
except crippled old Alvino, and wounded Dalton
lying in the men&rsquo;s quarters near at hand. Neither
of them was serviceable in such an emergency, and
Banjo, willing as he would be, seemed too badly hurt
to be of any use.</p>
<p>Frances pressed her to dismiss this intention.
Even if they knew which way to ride, it would be a
hopeless pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to go&mdash;towards the
rustlers&rsquo; settlement,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron grimly returned.</p>
<p>She was over her hysterical passion now, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' ></a>161</span>
steadied down into a state of desperate determination
to set out after the thieves and bring Nola back.
She did not know how it was to be accomplished, but
she felt her strength equal to any demand in the
pressure of her despair. She was lifting her foot
to the stirrup, thinly dressed as she was, her head
bare, the rifle in her hand, when Frances took her
by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go alone with Alvino, Mrs. Chadron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go, I tell you&mdash;let loose of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook off Frances&rsquo; restraining hand and turned
to her horse again. With her hand on the pommel
of the saddle she stopped, and turned to Alvino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and fetch me Chance&rsquo;s guns out of the bunkhouse,&rdquo;
she ordered.</p>
<p>Alvino hitched away, swinging his stiff leg, with
laborious, slow gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do anything against a crowd of
desperate men&mdash;they might kill you!&rdquo; Frances said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em kill me, then!&rdquo; She lifted her hand, as
if taking an oath. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll pay for this trick&mdash;every
man, woman, and child of them&rsquo;ll bleed for what
they&rsquo;ve done to me tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Alvino go to the camp up the river where
Mr. Chadron left the men, and tell them; they can
do more than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t drive him alone out of sight of the
lights in the house with fire. He&rsquo;d come back with
some kind of a lie before he&rsquo;d went a mile. I&rsquo;ll go
to &rsquo;em myself, honey&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' ></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till Alvino comes with them guns&mdash;I can
use &rsquo;em better than I can a rifle. Oh, why don&rsquo;t the
man hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and see what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Alvino came around the corral at that moment.
He had stopped to light a lantern, in his peculiar
Mexican mode of estimating the importance of time
and occasion, and came flashing it in short, violent
arcs as he swayed to swing his jointless leg.</p>
<p>Frances led out the other horse and was waiting
to mount when Alvino came panting up, the belt with
its two revolvers over his arm. Mrs. Chadron jerked
it from him with something hard and sharp on her
tongue like a curse. Banjo Gibson came into the
circle of light, a bandage on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see &rsquo;em. They knocked me down,
and when I come to she was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo&rsquo;s voice was full of self-censure, and his feet
were weak upon the ground. He began to talk the
moment the light struck him, and when he had finished
his little explanation he was standing beside
Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the house and lie down, Banjo,&rdquo; Mrs.
Chadron said; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t time to fool with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you two aimin&rsquo; to go to the post after help?&rdquo;
Banjo steadied himself on his legs by clinging to the
horse&rsquo;s mane as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; up the river after the men,&rdquo; Mrs.
Chadron told him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' ></a>163</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go after the men; that&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s job,&rdquo;
Banjo insisted. &ldquo;I know right where they&rsquo;re camped
at, you couldn&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em between now and morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no arguing Banjo out of it, no brushing
the little man aside. He was as firm as a man three
times his weight, and he took Mrs. Chadron by the
arm, like a son, and led her away from the horse with
a manner at once so firm and yet considerate that it
softened her stern heart and plunged her into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you bring Nola back to me I&rsquo;ll give her to
you, Banjo! I&rsquo;ll give her to you!&rdquo; she sobbed, as
she belted him with Chance Dalton&rsquo;s guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any reward in this world could drive me
through hell fire to lay my hands on it, you&rsquo;ve named
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Frances saw that Mrs. Chadron could be reasoned
with now, and she was grateful to Banjo for his opportune
arrival. For the night was vast and
unfriendly over that empty land, and filled with a
thousand shudderful dangers. She was afraid of it,
afraid to leave the lights of the house behind her
and ride out into it, no matter for all the peril that
poor little Nola might be facing in that cruel hour.</p>
<p>Banjo rode away. They stood clinging to each
other in the dim circle of Alvino&rsquo;s lantern-light,
listening to his horse until the distance muffled its
feet on the road.</p>
<p>Frances was chilled with the horror of that brigandish
act. Every movement of the wind in the
bushes made her skin crinkle and creep; every sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' ></a>164</span>
of animals in barn and corral was magnified into
some new danger. Mrs. Chadron was in far worse
state, with reason, certainly, for being so. Now that
the stimulation of her first wild outburst had been
exhausted, she stood wilted and weak, shivering with
her hands over her eyes, moaning and moaning in
piteous low wail.</p>
<p>Frances took the lantern from old Alvino&rsquo;s shaking
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and look for their tracks,&rdquo; she suggested,
forcing a note of eagerness into her words,
&ldquo;so we can tell the men, when they come back to
pick up the trail, how many there were and which
way they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if Chance was only able to go after them, if
he was only able!&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron wailed, following
Frances as she hurried along the wire fence that cut
the garden from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was somebody that knowed the lay of the
land,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron said, &ldquo;for that gate down there
back of the house is open. That&rsquo;s the way they come
and went&mdash;somebody that knowed the lay of the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances felt her heart die within her as the recollection
of another night in that garden flashed like
red fire in her mind. There was a picture, as she
stopped with closed eyes, struck cold and shuddering
by a fear she dared not own, of one flying, bent into
the shadows, along the garden path toward that gate.
Someone who knew the &ldquo;lay of the land!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' ></a>165</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear something?&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron whispered,
leaning close to her where she had stopped,
stock-still, as if she had struck a wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&mdash;I&mdash;saw something,&rdquo; Frances
answered, in faint, sick voice.</p>
<p>The white gate was swinging as the invaders had
left it, and in the soft ground beyond it they found
tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one man!&rdquo; said Mrs. Chadron, bending
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one track,&rdquo; said Frances, her
breath so feeble, her heart laboring so weakly that
she believed that she must die.</p>
<p>Alvino came up, and took the lead in tracking, with
the aptness for that trick that goes with primitive
minds such as his. Even in the farthest glimmer of
the light he could pick up the trail, and soon he led
them to the willows where the ravisher&rsquo;s horse had
been concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shoe was lost,&rdquo; said he, pointing, &ldquo;left one,
hind foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron stood looking in the direction that
the rider had gone with his precious burden, her eyes
straining into the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; come down here place of saddlin&rsquo;
that horse!&rdquo; she lamented, with a pang for her lost
opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have been gone, even then&mdash;I was past
here and didn&rsquo;t hear him,&rdquo; Frances said.</p>
<p>Still the vision persisted in her disturbed imagination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' ></a>166</span>
of that other night, of one leaning low in the
saddle, his fleet horse stretching its neck in desperation
for the distant refuge; the dash of pursuing
hoofs; the sound of shots up the river; the prayer
that she sent to heaven in his behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was somebody that knowed the lay of the
land,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron was repeating, with accusing
conviction.</p>
<p>They returned to the house, having done all that
they could do. It was doubtful whether the dumb,
plethoric nature of Mrs. Chadron made her capable
of suffering as Frances suffered, even with her greater
reason for pain of that cruel bereavement. Imaginative,
refined, sensitive as a harp, Frances reflected
every wild wrench of horror that Nola herself must
have been suffering as the horseman bore her along
in the thick night. She felt that she must scream,
but that some frightful thing smothered the voice
that struggled in her throat; that she must leap and
flee away, but a cloying power was heavy on her
limbs, binding her as if her feet were set in lava.</p>
<p>Somebody that knew the &ldquo;lay of the land.&rdquo; Great
God! could he fight that way, was it in Alan Macdonald
to make a hawk&rsquo;s dash like that? It was hard
to admit the thought, to give standing to the doubtful
accusation. But those whom they called &ldquo;rustlers&rdquo;
must have borne Nola away. Beyond the homesteaders
up the river were the mountains and the wild
country where no man made his home; except them
and the cattlemen and the cowboys attending the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' ></a>167</span>
herds, that country was unpeopled. There was nobody
to whom the deed could be charged but the
enemies that Chadron had made in his persecution
of the homesteaders.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were not of the type that Macdonald
described; maybe the cattlemen were just in their
arraignment of them for thieves and skulking rascals,
and Macdonald was no better than the reputation
that common report gave him. The mere fact of
his defense of them in words, and his association with
them, seemed to convict him there in the silence of
that black-walled court of night.</p>
<p>It was either that he was blinded to the deviltries
of his associates by his own high intentions, or as
shrewdly dishonest as any scoundrel that ever rode
the wilds. He could be that, and carry it off before
a sharper judge than she. So she said, finding it
hard to excuse his blindness, if blindness it might be;
unable to mitigate in any degree the blame, even passive
knowledge of the intent, of that base offense.</p>
<p>At length, through all the fog of her groping and
piecing together, she reached what she believed to be
the motive which lay behind the deed. The rustlers
doubtless were aware of the blow that Chadron was
preparing to deliver upon them in retaliation for his
recent losses. They had carried off his daughter to
make her the price of their own immunity, or else
to extract from him a ransom that would indemnify
them for quitting their lairs in the land upon which
they preyed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' ></a>168</span></div>
<p>She explained this to Mrs. Chadron when it became
clear to her own mind. Mrs. Chadron seemed to draw
considerable hope from it that she should receive her
daughter back again unharmed in a little while.</p>
<p>The rest of the night the two women spent at the
gate, and in the road up and down in front of it,
straining for the sound of a hoof that might bring
them tidings. Mrs. Chadron kept up a moaning like
an infant whose distress no mind can read, no hand
relieve. Now and then she burst into a shrill and
sudden cry, and time and again she imagined that
she heard Nola calling her, and dashed off along the
road with answering shout, to come back to her sad
vigil at the gate by and by on Frances&rsquo; arm, crushed
by this one great and sudden sorrow of her life.</p>
<p>Frances cheered her as much as might be with
promises of the coming day. At the first streak of
dawn, she told Mrs. Chadron, she would ride to the
post and engage her father in the quest for the stolen
girl. Soldiers would be thrown out over the country
for miles on every side; the cowards would be hemmed
in within a matter of hours, and Nola would be at
home, laughing over the experiences of her tragic
night.</p>
<p>Frances was in the saddle at daybreak. She had
left Mrs. Chadron in an uneasy sleep, watched over
by Maggie. Banjo had not returned; no word had
reached them from any source. Alvino let Frances
out through the gate at the back of the garden, for
it was her intention to follow the abductor&rsquo;s trail as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' ></a>169</span>
far as possible without being led into strange country.
Somebody, or some wandering herd of cattle, might
pass that way and obliterate the traces before pursuers
could be brought there.</p>
<p>The tracks of the raider&rsquo;s horse were deep in the
soft soil. She followed them as they cut across the
open toward the river road, angling northward. At
a place where the horse had stopped and made a
trampling in the lose earth&mdash;testimony of the fight
that Nola had made to get away&mdash;Frances started
at the sight of something caught on a clump of bull-berry
bushes close at hand. She drew near the object
cautiously, leaning and looking in the half light of
early morning. Presently assured, she reached out
and picked it up, and rode on with it in her hand.</p>
<p>Presently the trail merged into the river road,
where hoofprints were so numerous that Frances was
not skilful enough to follow it farther. But it
was something to have established that the scoundrel
was heading for the homesteaders&rsquo; settlement, and
that he had taken the road openly, as if he had nothing
to fear. Also, that bit of evidence picked from
the bushes might serve its purpose in the right time
and place.</p>
<p>She felt again that surge of indignation that had
fired her heart early in the sad night past. The man
who had lurked in the garden waiting his chance to
snatch Nola away, was certain of the protection to
which he fled. It was the daring execution of one
man, but the planning of many, and at the head of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' ></a>170</span>
them one with fire in his wild soul, quick passion in
his eyes, and mastery over his far-riding band. It
could be no other way.</p>
<p>When she came to the branching of the roads she
pulled up her horse and sat considering her course
a little while. Presently she rode forward again, but
not on the road that led to the army post.</p>
<p>She had proceeded a mile, perhaps, along the road
branching to the homesteaders&rsquo; settlement, upon
which she knew Macdonald&rsquo;s claim to lie somewhere
up the river, when she rounded an elbow screened by
tall-growing greasewood and came face to face with
a small cavalcade of dusty men. At the head of them
Alan Macdonald rode, beside an old man whose neck
was guttered like a wasted candle and his branching
great mustache gray as the dust on his bony shoulders.</p>
<p>She halted when she saw them, and they jerked up
their horses also, with startled suddenness, like men
riding in the expectation of danger and surprise.
Macdonald came forward in a moment, with respectful
salute, a look amounting almost to frightened
questioning in his face. For the sun was not up yet,
although its flame was on the heavens, and it was a
strange, wild place to meet a woman of Frances Landcraft&rsquo;s
caste unattended, and with the shadow of a
trouble in her face that made it old, like misery.</p>
<p>But there was no question of the unfriendliness of
that face for Alan Macdonald and the men who came
riding at his back. It was as cold as the gray earth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' ></a>171</span>
beneath her horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and its severity was reflected
in the very pose of her body, even in the grip
of her slender thighs as they clasped her saddle, sitting
there like a dragoon outrider who had appeared
to bar their way.</p>
<p>Frances was wearing the brown corduroy riding-habit
that she had worn on the day when she first
spoke to him. Her brown hair had fallen down until
it hid her ears, for she had ridden hard, and a strand
of it blew from beneath her cowboy hat in unheeded
caress across her cheek.</p>
<p>Macdonald saw her stiffen in the saddle and lift
herself a little from her seat as he drew near, his
companions stopping a little distance back. Her
eyes were stern and reproachful; a little frown
troubled her white forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was starting out to find you, Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo;
she said, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any service, Miss Landcraft&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk emptiness, and don&rsquo;t pretend!&rdquo; she
said, a flash of anger in her face. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a man&rsquo;s
way to fight, it&rsquo;s a coward&rsquo;s! Bring her back home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo; There was such
an astonished helplessness in his manner that it would
have convinced any unprejudiced mind of his innocence
in itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hurt you, I&rsquo;m
alone. You&rsquo;d just as well tell me how much money
you&rsquo;re going to demand, so I can set their minds at
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' ></a>172</span></div>
<p>Macdonald&rsquo;s face was hot; his eyes felt as if they
swam in fire. He put out his hand in a gesture almost
a command, his heavy eyebrows gathered in a frown,
an expression of sternness in his homely face that
made it almost majestic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be good enough to tell me what your
veiled accusations point to, Miss Landcraft, then I
can answer you by either yes or no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She unbent so far as to relate briefly what she believed
they knew better than herself already. But
behind her high air as she talked there was a secret
warm feeling for the strength of this man. It was a
quality of fine steel in the human mind and body such
as she never had seen so beautifully blended before.
In her own father there was something of it, but only
a reflection on water compared to this. It seemed the
temper of the desert, she thought, like that oriental
spirit which spread Islam&rsquo;s dark creed over half the
world.</p>
<p>When she had finished the relation of Nola&rsquo;s ravishment,
he sat with head drooped in dusty silence
a moment. Then he looked her in the eyes with such
a steady blaze of indignation that she felt her own
rage kindle to meet it. His clear, steady gaze was
an arraignment, an accusation on the ugly charge of
perversion of the truth as she knew it to be in the
bottom of her conscience when she had laid the crime
at the homesteaders&rsquo; hands. If he saw her at all, she
thought, it was as some small despicable thing, for
his eyes were so unflinching, as they poured their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' ></a>173</span>
steady fire into her own, that he seemed to be summing
up the final consequences which lay behind her,
along the dusty highway to the ranchhouse by the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said he, speaking slowly,
&ldquo;there are no cattle thieves among the homesteaders
in the settlement up the river, Miss Landcraft. I
have told you this before. Here, I want you to meet
some of them, and judge for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to Tom Lassiter and the three with
him, and they joined him there before her. In a few
words he told them who she was and the news that
she carried, as well as the accusation that went with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men, their neighbors, and myself not only
had no hand in this deed, but there&rsquo;s not one among
us that wouldn&rsquo;t put down his life to keep that young
woman from harm and give her back to her home.
We have our grievances against Saul Chadron, God
knows! and they are grave enough. But we don&rsquo;t
fight that way, Miss Landcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re innocent, then prove it by forcing the
men that carried her off, or the man, if there was
only one, to bring her back home. Then I&rsquo;ll believe
you. Maybe others will, too. What are you
riding the road so early for, all armed and suspicious,
if you&rsquo;re such honest men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to the agency after ammunition to
defend our homes, and our wives and children&mdash;such
of us as Saul Chadron and his hired hounds has left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' ></a>174</span>
children to, colonel&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; Tom Lassiter
answered, reproof in his kind old eyes.</p>
<p>Frances had unrolled the bit of evidence that she
had picked up from the bushes, and was holding it
on the horn of her saddle now, quite unconscious of
what her hands were doing, for she had forgotten the
importance of her find in the heat of that meeting.
Macdonald spurred forward, pointing to the thing in
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; he asked, a sharp note
of concern in his voice that made her start.</p>
<p>She told him. He took it from her and turned to
his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mark Thorn&rsquo;s cap!&rdquo; he said, holding it up,
his fingers in the crown.</p>
<p>Tom Lassiter nodded his slow head as the others
leaned to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul Chadron&rsquo;s chickens has come home to
roost,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Frances understood nothing of the excitement that
sprung out of the mention of the outlaw&rsquo;s name, for
Mark Thorn and his bloody history were alike unknown
to her. Her resentment mounted at being an
outsider to their important or pretended secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you know whose cap it is, it ought to be
easy for you to find the owner,&rdquo; she said, unable to
smother the sneer in her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t one of us,&rdquo; said a homesteader, with
grim shortness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, tossing her lofty head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' ></a>175</span></div>
<p>There was a pallor in Macdonald&rsquo;s weathered face,
as if somebody near and dear to himself was in extreme
peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may never see home again,&rdquo; he said. Then
quickly: &ldquo;Which way did he go, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him what she knew, not omitting the lost
horseshoe. Tom Lassiter bent in his saddle with
eagerness as she mentioned that particular, and ran
his eyes over the road like one reading the pages of
a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, pointing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seein&rsquo; it
all the way down, Alan. He was headin&rsquo; for the
hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances could not see the print of the shoeless
hoof, nor any peculiarity among the scores of tracks
that would tell her of Nola&rsquo;s abductor having ridden
that far along the road. She flushed as the thought
came to her that this was a trick to throw her attention
from themselves and the blame upon some fictitious
person, when they knew whose hands were guilty
all the time. The men were leaning in their saddles,
riding slowly back on their trail, talking in low voices
and sharp exclamations among themselves. She
spurred hotly after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chadron hasn&rsquo;t come home yet,&rdquo; she said,
addressing Macdonald, who sat straight in his saddle
to hear, &ldquo;but they expect him any hour. If you&rsquo;ll
say how much you&rsquo;re going to demand, and where you
want it paid, I&rsquo;ll carry the word to him. It might
hurry matters, and save her mother&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' ></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you repeated that,&rdquo; said Macdonald,
touching his hat in what he plainly meant a farewell
salute. He turned from her and drew Tom Lassiter
aside. In a moment he was riding back again the
way that he had come.</p>
<p>Frances looked at the unaccountable proceeding
with the eyes of doubt and suspicion. She did not
believe any of them, and had no faith in their mysterious
trackings and whisperings aside, and mad gallopings
off to hidden ends. As for Tom Lassiter and
his companions, they ranged themselves preparatory
to continuing their journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; our way, colonel&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo;
said Tom, gathering up his bridle-reins, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be
proud to ride along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was looking at the dust-cloud that rose
behind Macdonald. He was no longer in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has he gone?&rdquo; she inquired, her suspicion
growing every moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to find that cowman&rsquo;s child, young
lady, and take her home to her mother,&rdquo; Tom replied,
with dignity. He rode on. She followed, presently
gaining his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there such a man as Mark Thorn?&rdquo; she asked
after a little, looking across at Lassiter with sly
innuendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t no man by that name, but there&rsquo;s
a devil in the shape of a human man called that,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;what does he do?&rdquo; She reined a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' ></a>177</span>
nearer to Lassiter, feeling that there was little harm
in him apart from the directing hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hires out to kill off folks that&rsquo;s in the way
of the cattlemen at so much a head, miss; like some
hires out to kill off wolves. The Drovers&rsquo; Association
hires him, and sees that he gits out of jail if anybody
ever puts him in, and fixes it up so he walks safe with
the blood of no knowin&rsquo; how many innocent people on
his hands. That&rsquo;s what Mark Thorn does, ma&rsquo;am.
Chadron brought him in here a couple of weeks ago
to do some killin&rsquo; off amongst us homesteaders so the
rest &rsquo;d take a scare and move out. He give that
old devil a list of twenty men he wanted shot, and
Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s got that paper. His own name&rsquo;s
at the top of it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, catching her breath sharply, as
if in pain. Her face was white and cold. &ldquo;Did he&mdash;did
he&mdash;kill anybody here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed my little boy; he shot him down before
his mother&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Lassiter&rsquo;s guttered neck was agitated; the
muscles of his bony jaw knotted as he clamped his
teeth and looked straight along the road ahead of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little boy! Oh, what a coward he must
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a little tow-headed feller, and he had his
mother&rsquo;s eyes, as blue as robins&rsquo; eggs,&rdquo; said Tom,
his reminiscent sorrow so poignant that tears sprung
to her eyes in sympathy and plashed down unheeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' ></a>178</span>
and unchecked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been fifteen in November.
Talkin&rsquo; about fightin&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am, that&rsquo;s the way some
people fights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said that, Mr. Lassiter,&rdquo; she confessed,
hanging her head like a corrected child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t hear you now,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>They rode on a little way. Tom told her of the
other outrages for which Thorn was accountable in
that settlement. She was amazed as deeply as she
was shocked to hear of this, for if any word of it
had come to the post, it had been kept from her.
Neither was it ever mentioned in Chadron&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, when she mentioned that, &ldquo;it
ain&rsquo;t the kind of news the cattlemen spreads around.
But if we shoot one of them in defendin&rsquo; our own,
the news runs like a pe-rairie fire. They call us
rustlers, and come ridin&rsquo; up to swipe us out. Well,
they&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Chadron brought that terrible man in
here, why should the horrible creature turn against
him?&rdquo; she asked, doubt and suspicion grasping the
seeming fault in Lassiter&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chadron refused to make settlement with him for
the killin&rsquo; he done because he didn&rsquo;t git Macdonald.
Thorn told Alan that with his own bloody tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lassiter retailed to her eager ears the story of
Macdonald&rsquo;s capture of Thorn, and his fight with
Chadron&rsquo;s men when they came to set the old slayer
free, as Lassiter supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They turned him loose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' ></a>179</span>
now what I meant when I said Chadron&rsquo;s chickens
has come home to roost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know now.&rdquo; She turned, and looked back.
Remorse was heavy on her for the injustice she had
done Macdonald that day, and shame for her sharp
words bowed her head as she rode at old Tom Lassiter&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run the old devil down ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; Tom spoke
confidently, as of a thing that admitted no dispute,
&ldquo;and take that young woman home if he finds her
livin&rsquo;. Many thanks he&rsquo;ll git for it from them and
her. Like as not she&rsquo;ll bite the hand that saves her,
for she&rsquo;s a cub of the old bear. Well, let me tell you,
colonel&rsquo;s daughter, if she was to live a thousand
years, and pray all her life, she wouldn&rsquo;t no more
than be worthy at the end to wash that man&rsquo;s feet
with her tears and dry &rsquo;em on her hair, like that
poor soul you&rsquo;ve read about in the Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances slowed her horse as if overcome by a sudden
indecision, and turned in her saddle to look back
again. Again she had let him go away from her
misunderstood, his high pride hurt, his independent
heart too lofty to bend down to the mean adjustment
to be reached through argument or explanation. One
must accept Alan Macdonald for what his face proclaimed
him to be. She knew that now. He was not
of the mean-spirited who walk among men making
apology for their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone on,&rdquo; said Lassiter, slowing his horse
to her pace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' ></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was hasty and unjust,&rdquo; she confessed,
struggling to hold back her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you was,&rdquo; said Lassiter, frankly, &ldquo;but
everybody on the outside is unjust to all of us up
here. We&rsquo;re kind of outcasts because we fence the
land and plow it. But I want to tell you, Macdonald&rsquo;s
a man amongst men, ma&rsquo;am. He&rsquo;s fed the poor
and lifted up the afflicted, and he&rsquo;s watched with us
beside our sick and prayed with us over our dead. We
know him, no matter what folks on the outside say.
Well, we&rsquo;ll have to spur up a little, ma&rsquo;am, for we&rsquo;re
in a hurry to git back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They approached the point where the road to the
post branched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be fightin&rsquo; over here if Chadron
tries to drive us out,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;and we know he&rsquo;s
sent for men to come in and help him try it. We
don&rsquo;t want to fight, but men that won&rsquo;t fight for their
homes ain&rsquo;t the kind you&rsquo;d like to ride along the road
with, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the trouble can be settled some other
way,&rdquo; she suggested, thinking again of the hope that
she had brought with her to the ranch the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we bring the law in here, and elect officers
to see it put in force for every man alike, then this
trouble it&rsquo;ll come to an end. Well, if you ever feel
like we deserve a good word, colonel&rsquo;s daughter, we&rsquo;d
be proud to have you say it, for the feller that stands
up for the law and the Lord and his home agin the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' ></a>181</span>
cattlemen in this land, ma&rsquo;am, he&rsquo;s got a hard row to
hoe. Yes, we&rsquo;ll count any good words you might say
for us as so much gold. &lsquo;And the Levite, thou shalt
not forsake him, for he hath no part nor inheritance
with thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s voice was slow and solemn when he quoted
that Mosaic injunction. The appeal of the disinherited
was in it, and the pain of lost years. It
touched her like a sorrow of her own. Tears were
on her cheeks again as she parted from him, giving
him her hand in token of trust and faith, and rode on
toward the ranchhouse by the river.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>WHEN FRIENDS PART</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Banjo had returned, with fever in his wound.
Mrs. Chadron was putting horse liniment on it
when Frances entered the sitting-room where the
news of the tragedy had visited them the night past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to the post&mdash;I saw some men in the
road and turned back,&rdquo; Frances told them, sinking
down wearily in a chair before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you turned back, honey,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron
said, shaking her head sadly, &ldquo;for I was no end
worried about you. Them rustlers they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;
down from their settlement and gatherin&rsquo; up by
Macdonald&rsquo;s place, the men told Banjo, and no tellin&rsquo;
what they might &rsquo;a&rsquo; done if they&rsquo;d seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s face was not red with the glow of
peppers and much food this morning. One night of
anxiety had racked her, and left hollows under her
eyes and a flat grayness in her cheeks.</p>
<p>Banjo had brought no other news. The men had
scattered at daybreak to search for the trail of the
man who had carried Nola away, but Banjo, sore and
shaken, had come back depressed and full of pains.
Mrs. Chadron said that Saul surely would be home
before noonday, and urged Frances to go to her room
and sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m steadier this morning, I&rsquo;ll watch and wait,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' ></a>183</span>
she said, pressing the liniment-soaked cloth to
Banjo&rsquo;s bruised forehead.</p>
<p>Banjo contracted his muscles under the application,
shriveling up on himself like a snail in a fire,
for it was hot and heroic liniment, and strong medicine
for strong beasts and tougher men. Banjo&rsquo;s
face was a picture of patient suffering, but he said
nothing, and had not spoken since Frances entered
the room, for the treatment had been under way before
her arrival and there was scarcely enough
breath left in him to suffice for life, and none at all
for words. Frances had it in mind to suggest some
milder remedy, but held her peace, feeling that if
Banjo survived the treatment he surely would be in
no danger from his hurt.</p>
<p>The door of Nola&rsquo;s room was open as Frances
passed, and there was a depression in the counterpane
which told where the lost girl&rsquo;s mother had knelt beside
it and wet it with her tears. Frances wondered
whether she had prayed, lingering compassionately a
moment in the door.</p>
<p>The place was like Nola in its light and brightness
and surface comfort and assertive color notes of
happiness, hung about with the trophies of her short
but victorious career among the hearts of men. There
were photographs of youths on dressing-table, chiffonier,
and walls, and flaring pennants of eastern
universities and colleges. Among the latter, as if
it was the most triumphant trophy of them all, there
hung a little highland bonnet with a broken feather,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' ></a>184</span>
of the plaid Alan Macdonald had worn on the night
of Nola&rsquo;s mask.</p>
<p>Frances went in for a nearer inspection, and lifted
the little saucy bit of headgear from its place in
the decorations of Nola&rsquo;s wall. There could be no
doubting it; that was Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s bonnet, and
there was a bullet hole in it at the stem of the little
feather. The close-grazing lead had sheared the
plume in two, and gone on its stinging way straight
through the bonnet.</p>
<p>An exclamation of tender pity rose above her
breath. She fondled the little headdress and pressed
it to her bosom; she laid it against her cheek and
kissed it in consolation for its hurt&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s
balsam for all sufferings and heartbreaks, and incomparable
among the panaceas of all time.</p>
<p>In spite of her sympathy for Nola in her grave
situation, facing or undergoing what terrors no one
knew, there was a bridling of resentment against her
in Frances&rsquo; breast as she hung the marred bonnet
back in its place. It seemed to her that Nola had
exulted over both herself and Alan Macdonald when
she had put his bonnet on her wall, and that she had
kept it there after the coming of Frances to that
house in affront to friendship and mockery of the
hospitality that she professed to extend.</p>
<p>Nola had asked her to that house so that she
might see it hanging there; she had arranged it
and studied it with the cunning intent of giving her
pain. And how close that bullet had come to him!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' ></a>185</span>
It must have sheared his fair hair as it tore through
and dashed the bonnet from his head.</p>
<p>How she suffered in picturing his peril, happily
outlived! How her heart trembled and her strong
young limbs shook as she lived over in breathless
agony the crisis of that night! He had carried her
glove in his bonnet&mdash;she remembered the deft little
movement of stowing it there just the moment before
he bent and flashed away among the shadows. Excuse
enough for losing it, indeed!</p>
<p>But he had not told her of his escape to justify
the loss; proudly he had accepted the blame, and
turned away with the hurt of it in his unbending
heart.</p>
<p>She went back and took down the jaunty little
cap again, and kissed it with compensatory tenderness,
and left a jewel trembling on its crown from
the well of her honest brown eye. If ever amends
were made to any little highland bonnet in this
world, then Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s was that bonnet, hanging
there among the flaring pennants and trivial little
schoolgirl trophies on Nola Chadron&rsquo;s wall.</p>
<p>Chadron came home toward evening at the head of
sixty men. He had raised his army speedily and
effectively. These men had been gathered by the
members of the Drovers&rsquo; Association and sent to
Meander by special train, horses, guns, ammunition,
and provisions with them, ready for a campaign.</p>
<p>The cattlemen had made a common cause of this
sectional difficulty. Their indignation had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' ></a>186</span>
voiced very thoroughly by Mrs. Chadron when she
had spoken to Frances with such resentment of the
homesteaders standing up to fight. That was an
unprecedented contingency. The &ldquo;holy scare,&rdquo; such
as Mark Thorn and similar hired assassins spread in
communities of homesteaders, had been sufficient up
to that day. Now this organized front of self-defense
must be broken, and the bold rascals involved
must be destroyed, root and branch.</p>
<p>Press agents of the Drovers&rsquo; Association in
Cheyenne were sowing nation-wide picturesque
stories of the rustlers&rsquo; uprising. The ground was
being prepared for the graver news that was to
come; the cattlemen&rsquo;s justification was being carefully
arranged in advance.</p>
<p>Frances shuddered for the homesteaders when she
looked out of her window upon this formidable force
of lean-legged, gaunt-cheeked gun-fighters. They
were men of the trade, cowboys who had fought their
employers&rsquo; battles from the Rio Grande to the Little
Missouri. They were grim and silent men as they
pressed round the watering troughs at the windmill
with their horses, with flapping hats and low-slung
pistols, and rifles sheathed in leather cases on their
saddles.</p>
<p>She hurried down when she saw Chadron dismount
at the gate. Mrs. Chadron was there to meet him,
for she had stood guard at her window all day
watching for his dust beyond the farthest hill.
Frances could hear her weeping now, and Chadron&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' ></a>187</span>
heavy voice rising in command as she came to the
outer door.</p>
<p>Chadron was in the saddle again, and there was
hurrying among his men at barn and corral as they
put on bridles which they had jerked off, and tightened
girths and gathered up dangling straps. Chadron
was riding among them, large and commanding as
a general, with a cloud in his dark face that seemed
a threat of death.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was hurrying in to make a bundle
of some heavy clothing for Nola to protect her
against the night chill on her way home, which the
confident soul believed her daughter would be headed
upon before midnight. Saul the invincible was taking
the trail; Saul, who smashed his way to his desires
in all things. She gave Frances a hurried word of
encouragement as they passed outside the door.</p>
<p>Chadron was talking earnestly to his men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give fifty dollars bonus to the man that brings him
down,&rdquo; she heard him say as she drew near, &ldquo;and a
hundred to the first man to lay eyes on my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was hurrying to him with the information
that she had kept for his ear alone. She was
flushed with excitement as she came among the rough
horsemen like a bright bloom tossed among rusty
weeds. They fell back generously, not so much to
give her room as to see her to better advantage, passing
winks and grimaces of approval between themselves
in their free and easy way. Chadron gave his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' ></a>188</span>
hand in greeting as she spoke some hasty words of
comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Frances, for your friendship
in this bad business,&rdquo; he said, heartily, and with the
best that there was in him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a great
help and comfort to her mother, and if it wouldn&rsquo;t
be askin&rsquo; too much I&rsquo;d like for you to stay here with
her till we bring my little girl back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I intended to stay, Mr. Chadron; I didn&rsquo;t
come out to tell you that.&rdquo; She looked round at the
admiring faces, too plainly expressive of their approbation,
some of them, and plucked Chadron&rsquo;s
sleeve. &ldquo;Bend down&mdash;I want to tell you something,&rdquo;
she said, in low, quick voice.</p>
<p>Chadron stooped, his hand lightly on her shoulder,
in attitude of paternal benediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Macdonald, it was Mark Thorn,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s face displayed no surprise, shadowed
no deeper concern. Only there was a flitting look
of perplexity in it as he sat upright in his saddle
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; She watched him closely,
baffled by his unmoved countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of anybody in this country by
that name,&rdquo; he returned, shaking his head with a
show of entire sincerity. &ldquo;Who was tellin&rsquo; you about
him&mdash;who said he was the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little confused, and more than a little disappointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' ></a>189</span>
over the apparent failure of her news to
surprise from Chadron a betrayal of his guilty connection
with Mark Thorn, she related the adventure
of the morning, the finding of the cap, the meeting
with Macdonald and his neighbors. She reserved
nothing but what Lassiter had told her of Thorn&rsquo;s
employers and his bloody work in that valley.</p>
<p>Chadron shook his head with an air of serious
concern. There was a look of commiseration in his
eyes for her credulity, and shameful duping by the
cunning word of Alan Macdonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of Macdonald&rsquo;s lies,&rdquo; he said, something
so hard and bitter in his voice when he pronounced
that name that she shuddered. &ldquo;I never
heard of anybody named Thorn, here or anywheres
else. That rustler captain he&rsquo;s a deep one, Miss
Frances, and he was only throwin&rsquo; dust in your
eyes. But I&rsquo;m glad you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they said&mdash;the man he called Lassiter
said&mdash;that Macdonald would find Nola, and bring
her home,&rdquo; she persisted, unwilling yet to accept
Chadron&rsquo;s word against that old man&rsquo;s, remembering
the paper with the list of names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bald-faced enough to try even a trick like
that!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chadron looked impatiently toward the house,
muttering something about the slowness of &ldquo;them
women,&rdquo; avoiding Frances&rsquo; eyes. For she did not
believe Saul Chadron, and her distrust was eloquent
in her face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' ></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that he&rsquo;d pretend a rescue and bring
her back, just to make sympathy for himself and his
side of this trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; Chadron nodded,
frowning sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it seems impossible that anybody could be
so heartless and low!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man that&rsquo;d burn brands is low enough to go
past anything you could imagine in that little head
of yours, Miss Frances. Do you mind runnin&rsquo; in and
tellin&rsquo;&mdash;no, here she comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t this trouble between you and the homesteaders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homesteaders! They&rsquo;re cattle thieves, born in
&rsquo;em and bred in &rsquo;em, and set in the hide and hair
of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it be settled without all this fighting
and killing?&rdquo; she went on, pressing her point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now but the shoutin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to handle a rustler, Miss
Frances, and that&rsquo;s to salt his hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing&mdash;I&rsquo;d be glad&mdash;to go up there
myself, alone, and take any message you might send,&rdquo;
she offered. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;d listen to reason, even
to leaving the country if you want them to, rather
than try to stand against a ga&mdash;force like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand our side of it, Miss
Frances,&rdquo;&mdash;Chadron spoke impatiently, reaching
out for the bundle that his wife was bringing while
she was yet two rods away&mdash;&ldquo;for you ain&rsquo;t been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' ></a>191</span>
robbed and wronged by them nesters like we have.
You&rsquo;ve got to live it to know what it means, little
lady. We&rsquo;ve argued with &rsquo;em till we&rsquo;ve used up all
our words, but their fences is still there. Now we&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to clear &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Macdonald seemed hurt when I asked him
how much money they wanted you to pay as Nola&rsquo;s
ransom,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s deep, and he&rsquo;s tricky&mdash;too deep and too
slick for you.&rdquo; Chadron gathered up his reins,
leaned over and whispered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything
about that Thorn yarn to her&rdquo;&mdash;a sideways jerk of
the head toward his wife&mdash;&ldquo;her trouble&rsquo;s deep
enough without stirrin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron had the bundle now, and Mrs. Chadron
was helping him tie it behind his saddle, shaking her
head sadly as she handled the belongings of her child
with gentle touch. Tears were running down her
cheeks, but her usually ready words seemed dead
upon her tongue.</p>
<p>From the direction of the barn a little commotion
moved forward among the horsemen, like a wave
before a breeze. Banjo Gibson appeared on his horse
as the last thong was tied about Nola&rsquo;s bundle, his
hat tilted more than its custom to spare the sore
place over his eye.</p>
<p>The cowboys looked at his gaudy trappings with
curious eyes. Chadron gave him a short word of
greeting, and bent to kiss his wife good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you in this here thing, Saul,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' ></a>192</span>
Banjo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride to hell&rsquo;s back door to help you find
that little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron slewed in his saddle with an ugly scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any banjo-pickers on this job,
it&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s work!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Banjo seemed to droop with humiliation. Chuckles
and derisive words were heard among Chadron&rsquo;s
train. The little musician hung his bandaged head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you ortn&rsquo;t be hard on Banjo, he means well,&rdquo;
Mrs. Chadron pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can stay here and scratch the pigs,&rdquo; Chadron
returned, in his brutal way. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go now,
old lady, but we&rsquo;ll be back before morning, and we&rsquo;ll
bring Nola. Don&rsquo;t you worry any more; she&rsquo;ll be all
right&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t dare to harm a hair of her
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron looked at him with large hope and
larger trust in her yearning face, and Banjo slewed
his horse directly across the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you leave, Saul, I want to tell you this,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt me, and you&rsquo;ve hurt me <i>deep</i>!
I&rsquo;ll leave here before another hour passes by, and I&rsquo;ll
never set a boot-heel inside of your door ag&rsquo;in as
long as you live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hell!&rdquo; said Chadron, spurring forward into
the road.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s men rode away after him, except five
whom he detailed to stay behind and guard the
ranch. These turned their horses into the corral,
made their little fire of twigs and gleaned brush
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' ></a>193</span>
in their manner of wood-scant frugality, and over
it cooked their simple dinner, each man after his
own way.</p>
<p>Banjo led his horse to the gate in front of the
house and left it standing there while he went in
to get his instruments. Mrs. Chadron was moved
to a fresh outburst of weeping by his preparations
for departure, and the sad, hurt look in his simple
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here, Banjo; don&rsquo;t you go!&rdquo; she
begged. &ldquo;Saul he didn&rsquo;t mean any harm by what
he said&mdash;he won&rsquo;t remember nothing about it when
he comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember it,&rdquo; Banjo told her, shaking his
head in unbending determination, &ldquo;and I couldn&rsquo;t
be easy here like I was in the past. If I was to try
to swaller a bite of Saul Chadron&rsquo;s grub after this
it&rsquo;d stick in my throat and choke me. No, I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo;,
mom, but I&rsquo;m carryin&rsquo; away kind thoughts of you
in my breast, never to be forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo hitched the shoulder strap of the instrument
from which he took his name with a jerking of
the shoulder, and settled it in place; he took up his
fiddle box and hooked it under his arm, and offered
Mrs. Chadron his hand. She was crying, her face
in her apron, and did not see. Frances took the
extended hand and clasped it warmly, for the little
musician and his homely small sentiments had found
a place in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t leave until your head gets better,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' ></a>194</span>
she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re hardly able to take another long
ride after being in the saddle all night, hurt like
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo looked at her with pain reflected in his
shallow eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hurt that gives me my misery is where it
can&rsquo;t be seen,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you goin&rsquo;, Banjo, with the country
riled up this way, and you li&rsquo;ble to be shot down any
place by them rustlers?&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron asked, looking
at him appealingly, her apron ready to stem her
gushing tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over to the mission and stay with Mother
Mathews till I&rsquo;m healed up. I&rsquo;ll be welcome in that
house; I&rsquo;d be welcome there if I was blind, and had
m&rsquo; back broke and couldn&rsquo;t touch a string.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would, Banjo,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s married to a Injun, but she&rsquo;s as white as
a angel&rsquo;s robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good soul, Banjo, as good as ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances took advantage of Banjo&rsquo;s trip to the
reservation to send a note to her father apprising
him of the tragedy at the ranch. Banjo buttoned it
inside his coat, mounted his horse, and rode away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron watched him out of sight with
lamentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; stayed&mdash;it &rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been all right
with Saul; Saul didn&rsquo;t mean any harm by what he
said. He&rsquo;s the tender-heartedest man you ever saw,
he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a body&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s for a farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' ></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Banjo is a man to hold a grudge
very long,&rdquo; Frances told her, looking after the retreating
musician, her thoughts on him but hazily,
but rather on a little highland bonnet with a bullet
hole in its crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron agreed, plucking
up a little brightness. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a bad sign, a mighty
bad sign, when a friend parts from you with a hurt
in his heart that way, and leaves your house in a
huff and feels put out like Banjo does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;we let them go away from
us too often that way, with sore hearts that even a
little word might ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with such wistful regret that the older
woman felt its note through her own deep gloom.
She groped out, tears blinding her, until her hand
found her young friend&rsquo;s, and then she clasped it,
and stood holding it, no words between them.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XV_ONE_ROAD'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>ONE ROAD</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Twenty-four hours after Banjo&rsquo;s departure
a messenger arrived at the ranchhouse. It was
one of the cowboys attached to the ranch, and he
came with his right arm in a sling. He was worn,
and beaten out by long hours in the saddle and the
pain of his wound.</p>
<p>He said they had news of Nola, and that Chadron
sent word that she would be home before another
night passed. This intelligence sent Mrs. Chadron
off to bedroom and kitchen to make preparations for
her reception and restoration.</p>
<p>As she left the room Frances turned to the messenger,
who stood swinging his big hat awkwardly
by the brim. She untied the sling that held his
wounded arm and made him sit by the table while
she examined his injury, concerning which Mrs.
Chadron, in her excitement, had not even inquired.</p>
<p>The shot had gone through the forearm, grazing
the bone. When Frances, with the aid of Maggie,
the Mexican woman with tender eyes, had cleansed
and bound up the wound, she turned to him with a
decisive air of demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me the truth,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He was a bashful man, with a long, sheepish nose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' ></a>197</span>
and the bluest of harmless eyes. He started a little
when she made that demand, and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the boss told me to say,&rdquo; he demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did; but what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we ain&rsquo;t heard hide nor hair of her&rdquo;&mdash;he
looked round cautiously, lest Mrs. Chadron surprise
him in the truth&mdash;&ldquo;and them rustlers they&rsquo;re clean
gone and took everything but their houses and fences
along&mdash;beds and teams and stock, and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she repeated, staring at him blankly;
&ldquo;where have they gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdonald&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; it; that man&rsquo;s got brainds,&rdquo;
the cowboy yielded, with what he knew to be unlawful
admiration of the enemy&rsquo;s parts. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s herdin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
back in the hills where they&rsquo;ve built a regular fort,
they say. Some of us fellers caught up to a few
of the stragglers last night, and that&rsquo;s when I got
this arm put on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any of the rustlers been killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted, disgustedly, &ldquo;they ain&rsquo;t!
We&rsquo;ve burnt all the shacks we come to, and cut their
fences, but they all got slick and clean away, down
to the littlest kid. But the boss&rsquo;s after &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he
added, with brisk hopefulness, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll have better
news by mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron himself was the next rider to arrive at
that anxious house, and he came as the messenger of
disaster. He arrived between midnight and morning,
his horse spur-gashed, driven to the limit, himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' ></a>198</span>
sunken-eyed from his anxiety and hard pursuit of
his elusive enemy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was asleep when he entered the living-room
where Frances was keeping lonely watch
before the chimney fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; she asked, hastening to meet
him.</p>
<p>Chadron stood there gray and dusty, his big hat
down hard on his head, his black eyes shooting inquiry
into the shadowed room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upstairs, asleep&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only just been able to
persuade her to lie down and close her eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use to wake her up for bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found Nola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know right where she is. I could put my hand
on her if I could reach her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; said Chadron, bursting into a fire of
passion, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I fly like an eagle? Young
woman, I&rsquo;ve got to tell you I&rsquo;ve been beat and tricked
for the first time in my life! They&rsquo;ve got my men
hemmed in, I tell you&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em shut up in
a ca&ntilde;on as tight as if they was nailed in their
coffins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Chadron had been clearer of sight and mind in
that moment of his towering anger, he would have
seen her cheeks flush at his words, and her nostrils
dilate and her breath come faster. But he was blind;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' ></a>199</span>
his little varnish of delicacy was gone. He was just
a ranting, roaring, dark-visaged brute with murder
in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That damned Macdonald done it, led &rsquo;em into it
like they was blind! He&rsquo;s a wolf, and he&rsquo;s got the
tricks of a wolf, he skulked ahead of &rsquo;em with a little
pack of his rustlers and led &rsquo;em into his trap, then
the men he had hid there and ready they popped up
as thick as grass. They&rsquo;ve got fifty of my men shut
up there where they can&rsquo;t git to water, and where
they can&rsquo;t fight back. Now, what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think,&rdquo; she said, throwing
up her head, her eyes as quick and bright as water
in the sun, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the judgment of God! I
glory in the trick Alan Macdonald played you, and I
pray God he can shut your hired murderers there till
the last red-handed devil dies of thirst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron fell back from her a step, his eyes staring,
his mouth open, his hand lifted as if to silence
her. He stood so a moment, casting his wild look
around, fearful that somebody else had heard her
passionate denunciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the hell do you mean?&rdquo; he asked,
crouching as he spoke, his teeth clenched, his voice
smothered in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I know you&rsquo;re a murderer&mdash;and
worse! You hired those men, like you hired Mark
Thorn, to come here and murder those innocent men
and their families!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' ></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what if I did?&rdquo; he said, standing straight
again, his composure returning. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re thieves;
they&rsquo;ve been livin&rsquo; off of my cattle for years. Anybody&rsquo;s
got a right to kill a rustler&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only
cure. Well, they&rsquo;ll not pen them men of mine up
there till they crack for water, I&rsquo;ll bet you a purty
on that! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; after soldiers, and this time I&rsquo;ll
git &rsquo;em, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers!&rdquo; said she, in amazement. &ldquo;Will you
ask the United States government to march troops
here to save your hired assassins? Well, you&rsquo;ll not
get troops&mdash;if there&rsquo;s anything that I can say
against you to keep you from it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep out of it, my little lady; you ain&rsquo;t got
no call to mix up with a bunch of brand-burnin&rsquo;
thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not thieves, and you know it! Macdonald
never stole an animal from you or anybody
else; none of the others ever did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, as well as I know what&rsquo;s in your mind
about the troops. You&rsquo;ll go over father&rsquo;s head to
get them. Well, by the time he wires to the department
the facts I&rsquo;m going to lay before him, I&rsquo;d like to
see the color of the trooper you&rsquo;ll get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep your mouth shut, and hold your
finger out of this pie before you git it burnt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not keep my mouth shut!&rdquo; She began moving
about the room, picking up her belongings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to saddle my horse and go to the post right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' ></a>201</span>
now, and the facts of your bloody business will be in
Washington before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo;&mdash;to the&mdash;post!&rdquo; Chadron&rsquo;s
words were slow and hard. He stood with his back
to the door. &ldquo;This house was opened to you as a
friend, not as a traitor and a spy. You&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo;
to put your foot outside of it into any business of
mine, no matter which way you lean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All day she had been dressed ready to mount and
ride in any emergency, her hat, gloves and quirt on
the table before the fireplace. In that sober habit
she appeared smaller and less stately, and Saul Chadron,
with his heavy shoulders against the closed door,
towered above her, dark and angrily determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get my horse,&rdquo; said she, standing
before him, waiting for him to quit the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay right in this house, there&rsquo;s
where you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay; and you&rsquo;ll stay till I&rsquo;ve
cleaned out Macdonald and his gang, down to the
last muddy-bellied wolf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll answer for detaining me here, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no man in this country that I answer
to!&rdquo; returned Chadron, not without dignity,
for power undisputed for so long, and in such large
affairs, had given him a certain manner of imperialism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out where your mistake is, to your
bitter cost, before many days have gone over your
head. Your master is on the way; you&rsquo;ll meet him
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' ></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well ca&rsquo;m down, and take that hat
off and make yourself easy, Miss Frances; you ain&rsquo;t
goin&rsquo; to the post tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open that door, Mr. Chadron! For the memory
of your daughter, be a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actin&rsquo; for the best, Miss Frances.&rdquo; Chadron
softened in speech, but unbent in will. &ldquo;You
must stay here till we settle them fellers. I ain&rsquo;t
got time to bring any more men up from Cheyenne&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
got to have help within the next twenty-four
hours. You can see how your misplaced feelin&rsquo;s
might muddle and delay me, and hold off the troopers
till they&rsquo;ve killed off all of my men in that ca&ntilde;on
back yonder in the hills. It&rsquo;s for the best, I tell
you; you&rsquo;ll see it that way before daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity about your gallant cutthroats! It&rsquo;s
time the rest of this country knew something about
the methods of you cattlemen up here, and the way
you harass and hound and murder honest men that
are trying to make homes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Frances! ca&rsquo;m down, ca&rsquo;m down!&rdquo;
coaxed Chadron, spreading his hands in conciliatory
gesture, as if to smooth her troubled spirits, and
calm her down by stroking her, like a cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you want to call out the army to rescue
that pack of villains, you want to enlist the government
to help you murder more children! Well, I&rsquo;m
a daughter of the army; I&rsquo;m not going to stand
around and see you pull it down to any such business
as yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' ></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better make up your mind to take it easy,
now, Miss Frances. Put down your hat and things,
now, and run along off to bed like a good little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned from him with a disdainful toss of the
head, and walked across to the window where Mrs.
Chadron&rsquo;s great chair stood beside her table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want it known that I was forced to
leave your house by the window?&rdquo; she asked, her
hand on the sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do you any good if you do,&rdquo; Chadron
growled, turning and throwing the door open with
gruff decision. He stood a moment glowering at her,
his shoulders thrust into the room. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave
here till I&rsquo;m ready for you to go&mdash;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put
my men on the watch for you. If you try it afoot
they&rsquo;ll fetch you back, and if you git stubborn and
try to ride off from &rsquo;em, they&rsquo;ll shoot your horse.
You take my word that I mean it, and set down and
be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed the door. She heard his heavy tread,
careless, it seemed, whether he broke the troubled
sleep of his wife, pass out by way of the kitchen.
She returned to the fire, surging with the outrage
of it, and sat down to consider the situation.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Chadron meant what he
had said. This was only a mild proceeding to suppress
evidence compared to his usual methods, as witnessed
by the importation of Mark Thorn, and now
his wholesale attempt with this army of hired gunslingers.
But above the anger and indignation there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' ></a>204</span>
was the exultant thought of Macdonald&rsquo;s triumph
over the oppressor of the land. It glowed like a
bright light in the turmoil of her present hour.</p>
<p>She had told Chadron that his master was on the
way, and she had seen him swell with the cloud of
anger that shrouded his black heart. And she knew
that he feared that swift-footed man Macdonald,
who had outgeneraled him and crippled him before
he had struck a blow. Well, let him have his brutal
way until morning; then she would prevail on Mrs.
Chadron to rescind his order and let her go home.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to be hoped or dreaded
in the way of news that night, Frances suppressed
her wrath and went upstairs and to bed. But not
to sleep; only to lie there with her hot cheeks burning
like fever, her hot heart triumphing in the complete
confidence and justification of Macdonald that
Chadron&rsquo;s desperate act had established. She glowed
with inner warmth as she told herself that there would
be no more doubting, no more swaying before the
wind of her inclination. Her heart had read him
truly that night in the garden close.</p>
<p>She heard Chadron ride away as she watched there
for the dawn, and saw the cowboy guard that he
had established rouse themselves while the east was
only palely light and kindle their little fires. Soon
the scent of their coffee and bacon came through her
open window. Then she rose and dressed herself in
her saddle garb again, and went tiptoeing past Mrs.
Chadron&rsquo;s door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' ></a>205</span></div>
<p>Since going to bed Mrs. Chadron bad not stirred.
She seemed to have plunged over the precipice of
sleep and to be lying stunned at the bottom. Frances
felt that there was no necessity for waking her out
of that much-needed repose, for the plan that she
had formulated within the past few minutes did not
include an appeal for Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s assistance
in it.</p>
<p>Experience told her that Mrs. Chadron would
accept unquestioningly the arrangements and orders
of her husband, in whom her faith was boundless and
her confidence without bottom. She would advance
a hundred tearful pleas to take the edge off Frances&rsquo;
indignant anger, and weep and implore, but ten to
one remain as steadfast as a ledge in her fealty to
Saul. So Frances was preparing to proceed without
her help or hindrance.</p>
<p>She went softly into the room where she had faced
Chadron a few hours before, and crossed to the fireplace,
where the last coals of the fire that had kept
her company were red among the ashes. It was
dark yet, only a little grayness, like murky water,
showing under the rim of the east, but she knew
where the antlers hung above the mantel, with the
rifle in its case, and the two revolvers which Alvino
had brought to his mistress from the wounded foreman
in the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>But the antlers were empty. She felt them over
with contracting heart, then struck a match to make
sure. The guns were gone. Saul Chadron had removed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' ></a>206</span>
them, foreseeing that they might stand her
in the place of a friend.</p>
<p>She lit a lamp and began a search of the lower
part of the house for arms. There was not a single
piece left in any of the places where they commonly
were a familiar sight. Even the shotgun was gone
from over the kitchen door. She returned to the
sitting-room and laid some sticks on the coals, and
sat leaning toward the blaze in that sense of comradeship
that is as old between man and fire as the
servitude of that captive element.</p>
<p>Her elbows were on her knees, and her gloved
hands were clasped, and the merry little fire laughed
up into her fixed and thoughtful eyes.</p>
<p>Fire has but one mood, no matter what it cheers
or destroys. It always laughs. There is no melancholy
note in it, no drab, dull color of death such
as the flood comes tainted with. Even while it eats
away our homes and possessions, it has a certain
comfort in its touch and glow if we stand far enough
away.</p>
<p>Dawn broadened; the watery light came in like
cold. Frances got up, shivering a little at the unfriendly
look of the morning. She thought she heard
a cautious foot stealing away from the window, and
turned from it with contemptuous recollection of
Chadron&rsquo;s threat to set spies over her.</p>
<p>Frances left the house with no caution to conceal
her movements, and went to the barn. Alvino was
hobbling about among the horses with his lantern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' ></a>207</span>
He gave her an open and guileless good-morning, and
she told him to saddle her horse.</p>
<p>She was determined to ride boldly out of the gate
and away, hardly convinced that even those seasoned
ruffians would take a chance of hitting her by firing
at her horse. None of the imported shooters was in
sight as she mounted before the barn door, but two
of them lounged casually at the gate as she approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was you aimin&rsquo; to go so early?&rdquo; asked one
of them, laying hand on her bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the daughter of Colonel Landcraft, commanding
officer at Fort Shakie, and I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo;
she answered, as placidly and good-humoredly as if
it might be his regular business to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have to edge in on your plans,
sissy,&rdquo; the fellow returned, familiarly, &ldquo;but nobody
goes away from this ranch for some little time to
come. That&rsquo;s the boss&rsquo;s orders. Don&rsquo;t you know
them rustlers is shootin&rsquo; up the country ever&rsquo; which
way all around here? Shucks! It ain&rsquo;t safe for no
lady to go skylarkin&rsquo; around in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me&mdash;they know there&rsquo;s a
regiment of cavalry at the post standing up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon them rustlers cares much more
about them troopers than we do, sis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please open the gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to refuse a lady, but I dasn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; He
shook his head in exaggerated gravity, and his companion
covered a sputtering laugh with his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' ></a>208</span></div>
<p>Frances felt her resolution to keep her temper dissolving.
She shifted her quirt as the quick desire
to strike him down and ride over his ugly grinning
face flashed through her. But the wooden stock was
light under the braided leather; she knew that she
could not have knocked a grunt out of the tough
rascal who barred her way with his insolent leer in
his mean squint eyes. He was a man who had nothing
to lose, therefore nothing to fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s dangerous for me to go alone, get your
horse and come with me. I&rsquo;ll see that you get more
out of it than you make working for Chadron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow squinted up at her with eyes half-shut,
in an expression of cunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you trot along back and behave you&rsquo;self,
before I have to take you down and spank you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The other three men of the ranch guard came
waddling up in that slouching gait of saddle-men,
cigarettes dangling from their lips. Frances saw
that she would not be allowed to pass that way.
But they were all at that spot; none of them could
be watching the back gate. She wheeled her long-legged
cavalry horse to make a dash for it, and came
face to face with Mrs. Chadron, who was hurrying
from the house with excited gesticulations, pointing
up the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;, it looks like one of the boys,
I saw him from the upstairs winder!&rdquo; she announced,
&ldquo;Where was you goin&rsquo;, honey?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' ></a>209</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I was starting home, Mrs. Chadron, but these
men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he comes!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Chadron, hastening
to the gate.</p>
<p>A horseman had come around the last brush-screened
turn of the road, and was drawing near.
Frances felt her heart leap like a hare, and a delicious
feeling of triumph mingle with the great pride
that swept through her in a warm flood. Tears
were in her eyes, half-blinding her; a sob of gladness
rose in her breast and burst forth a little happy cry.</p>
<p>For that was Alan Macdonald coming forward on
his weary horse, bearing something in his arms
wrapped in a blanket, out of which a shower of long
hair fell in bright cascade over his arm.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron pressed her lips tight. Neither cry
nor groan came out of them as she stood steadying
herself by a straining grip on the gate, watching
Macdonald&rsquo;s approach. None of them knew whether
the burden that he bore was living or dead; none
of them in the group at the gate but Frances knew
the rider&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>One of the cowboys opened the gate wide, without
a word, to let him enter. Mrs. Chadron lifted her
arms appealingly, and hurried to his side as he
stopped. Stiffly he leaned over, his inert burden held
tenderly, and lowered what he bore into Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s
outstretched arms.</p>
<p>With that change of position there was a sharp
movement in the muffling blanket, two arms reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' ></a>210</span>
up with the quick clutching of a falling child, and
clasped him about the neck. Then a sharp cry of
waking recognition, and Nola was sobbing on her
mother&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Alan Macdonald said no word. The light of the
sunrise was strong on his face, set in the suffering of
great weariness; the stiffness of his long and burdened
ride was in his limbs. He turned his dusty
horse, with its head low-drooping, and rode out the
way that he had come. No hand was lifted to stop
him, no voice raised in either benediction or curse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was soothing her daughter, who was
incoherent in the joy of her delivery, holding her
clasped in her arms. Beyond that bright head there
was no world for that mother then; save for the
words which she crooned in the child&rsquo;s ears there was
no message in her soul.</p>
<p>Frances felt tears streaking her face in hot rivulets
as she sat in her saddle, struck inactive by the great
admiration, the boundless pride, that this unselfish
deed woke in her. She never had, in her life of
joyousness, experienced such a high sense of human
admiration before.</p>
<p>The cowboy who had opened the gate still held it
so, the spell of Macdonald&rsquo;s dramatic arrival still
over him. With his comrades he stood speechless,
gazing after the departing horseman.</p>
<p>Frances touched her horse lightly and rode after
him. Mother and daughter were so estranged from
all the world in that happy moment of reunion that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' ></a>211</span>
neither saw her go, and the guards at the gate, either
forgetful of their charge or softened by the moving
scene, did not interpose to stop her.</p>
<p>Macdonald raised his drooping head with quick
start as she came dashing to his side. She was weeping,
and she put out her hand with a motion of entreaty,
her voice thick with sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wronged you and slandered you,&rdquo; she said, in
bitter confession, &ldquo;and I let you go when I should
have spoken! I&rsquo;m not worthy to ride along this road
with you, Alan Macdonald, but I need your protection,
I need your help. Will you let me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked his horse and looked across at her, a
tender softening coming into his tired face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, God bless you! there&rsquo;s only one road in
the world for you and me,&rdquo; said he. His hand met
hers where it fluttered like a dove between them;
his slow, translating smile woke in his eyes and
spread like a sunbeam over his stern lips.</p>
<p>Behind them Mrs. Chadron was calling. Frances
turned and waved her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, Frances, come back here!&rdquo; Mrs.
Chadron&rsquo;s words came distinctly to them, for they
were not more than a hundred yards from the gate,
and there was a note of eagerness in them, almost
a command. Both of them turned.</p>
<p>There was a commotion among the men at the
gate, a hurrying and loud words. Nola was beckoning
to Frances to return; now she called her name,
with fearful entreaty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' ></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Chance Dalton with his arm in a sling,&rdquo;
said Macdonald, looking at her curiously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chadron has made them all believe that you stole
Nola for the sole purpose of making a pretended
rescue to win sympathy for your cause,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Even Nola will believe it&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;ve told her.
Chadron has offered a reward of fifty dollars&mdash;a
bonus, he called it, so maybe there is more&mdash;to the
man that kills you! Come on&mdash;quick! I&rsquo;ll tell you
as we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald&rsquo;s horse was refreshed in some measure
by the diminishing of its burden, but the best that
it could do was a tired, hard-jogging gallop. In a
little while they rounded the screen of brush which
hid them from the ranchhouse and from those who
Frances knew would be their pursuers in a moment.
Quickly she told him of her reason for wanting to
go to the post, and Chadron&rsquo;s reason for desiring
to hold her at the ranch.</p>
<p>Macdonald looked at her with new life in his weary
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win now; you were the one recruit I
lacked,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll kill you&mdash;Mrs. Chadron can&rsquo;t hold
them back&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t want to hold them back&mdash;for
she&rsquo;s full of Chadron&rsquo;s lies about you. Your
horse is worn out&mdash;you can&rsquo;t outrun them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are there besides the five I saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Dalton, and he&rsquo;s supposed to be crippled.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' ></a>213</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, easily, as if only five whole
men and a cripple didn&rsquo;t amount to so much, taken
all in the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your men up there need your leadership and
advice. Take my horse and go; he can outrun
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her admiringly, but with a little reproving
shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s neither mercy nor manhood in any man
that rides in Saul Chadron&rsquo;s pay,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d overtake you on this old plug before you&rsquo;d
gone a mile. The one condition on which I part company
with you is that you ride ahead, this instant,
and that you put your horse through for all that&rsquo;s in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you to fight six of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staying here would only put you in unnecessary
danger. I ask you to go, and go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go!&rdquo; She said it finally and emphatically.</p>
<p>Macdonald checked his horse; she held back her
animal to the slow pace of his. Now he offered his
hand, as in farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can assure them at the post that we&rsquo;ll not
fire on the soldiers&mdash;they can come in peace. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going!&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not consider you, Frances&mdash;they&rsquo;ll not
hold their fire on your account. You&rsquo;re a rustler
now, you&rsquo;re one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' ></a>214</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You said&mdash;there&mdash;was&mdash;only&mdash;one&mdash;road,&rdquo;
she told him, her face turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that way, then, to the left&mdash;up that dry
bed of Horsethief Ca&ntilde;on.&rdquo; He spoke with a lift of
exultation, of pride, and more than pride. &ldquo;Ride
low&mdash;they&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XVI_DANGER_AND_DIGNITY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>DANGER AND DIGNITY</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;Did you carry her that way all the way home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances asked the question abruptly, like
one throwing down some troublesome and heavy thing
that he has labored gallantly to conceal. It was the
first word that she had spoken since they had taken
refuge from their close-pressing pursuers in the dugout
that some old-time homesteader had been driven
away from by Chadron&rsquo;s cowboys.</p>
<p>Macdonald was keeping his horse back from the
door with the barrel of his rifle, while he peered out
cautiously again, perplexed to understand the reason
why Dalton had not led his men against them in a
charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all the way, Frances. She rode behind me
till she got so cold and sleepy I was afraid she&rsquo;d fall
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll bet she put on half of it!&rdquo; she said,
spitefully. &ldquo;She looked strong enough when you
put her down there at the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This unexpected little outburst of jealousy was
pleasant to his ears. Above the trouble of that morning,
and of the future which was charged with it to
the blackness of complete obscuration, her warrant of
affection was like a lifting sunbeam of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure out what Dalton and that gang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' ></a>216</span>
mean by this,&rdquo; said he, the present danger again
pressing ahead of the present joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a man dodge behind that big rock across
there a minute ago,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep back away from that door&mdash;don&rsquo;t
lean over out of that corner!&rdquo; he admonished, almost
harshly. &ldquo;If you get where you can see, you can
be seen. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his watch at the little hole that he had
drilled beside the weight-bowed jamb of the door in
the earth front of their refuge. She sat silent in
her dark corner across from him, only now and then
shaking her glove at the horses when one of them
pricked up his ears and shewed a desire to dodge out
into the sunlight and pleasant grazing spread on the
hillside.</p>
<p>It was cold and moldy in the dugout, and the
timbers across the roof were bent under the weight
of the earth. It looked unsafe, but there was only
one place in it that a bullet could come through, and
that was the open door. There was no way to shut
that; the original battens of the homesteader lay
under foot, broken apart and rotting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it beats me!&rdquo; said he, his eye to the peephole
in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d keep one of the horses on this side it
wouldn&rsquo;t crowd your corner so,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better, only they&rsquo;ll cut loose at anything
that passes the door. They&rsquo;ll show their hand
before long.&rdquo; He enlarged the hole to admit his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' ></a>217</span>
rifle barrel. She watched him in silence. Which was
just as well, for she had no words to express her
admiration for his steadiness and courage under the
trying pressure of that situation. Her confidence
in him was so entire that she had no fear; it did not
admit a question of their safe deliverance. With
him at her side, this dangerous, grave matter seemed
but a passing perplexity. She left it to him with the
confidence and up-looking trust of a child.</p>
<p>While she understood the peril of their situation,
fear, doubt, had no place in her mind. She was under
the protection of Alan Macdonald, the infallible.</p>
<p>No matter what others may think of a man&rsquo;s infallibility,
it is only a dangerous one who considers
himself endowed with that more than human attribute.
Macdonald did not share her case of mind as
he stood with his eye to the squint-hole that he had
bored beside the rotting jamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find her? where was she?&rdquo; she
asked, her thoughts more on the marvel of Nola&rsquo;s
return than her own present danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost Thorn&rsquo;s trail that first day,&rdquo; he returned,
&ldquo;and then things began to get so hot for us up the
valley that I had to drop the search and get those
people back to safety ahead of Chadron&rsquo;s raid. Yesterday
afternoon we caught a man trying to get
through our lines and down into the valley. He
was a half-breed trapper who lives up in the foothills,
carrying a note down to Chadron. I&rsquo;ve got that
curious piece of writing around me somewhere&mdash;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' ></a>218</span>
can read it when this blows by. Anyway, it was from
Thorn, demanding ten thousand dollars in gold. He
wanted it sent back by the messenger, and he prescribed
some picturesque penalties in case of failure
on Chadron&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you found her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t very well ask anybody else to go after
her,&rdquo; he admitted, with a modest reticence that
amounted almost to being ashamed. &ldquo;After I made
sure that we had Chadron&rsquo;s raiders cooped up where
they couldn&rsquo;t get out, I went up and got her. Thorn
wasn&rsquo;t there, nobody but the Indian woman, the
&rsquo;breed&rsquo;s wife. She was the jailer&mdash;a regular wildcat
of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all there was to be told, it seemed, as far
as Macdonald was concerned. He had the hole in the
wall&mdash;at which he had worked as he talked&mdash;to his
liking now, and was squinting through it like a telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nola wasn&rsquo;t afraid to come with you,&rdquo; she said,
positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t appear to be, Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she <i>knew</i> she was safe, no matter how little
she deserved any kindness at your hands. I know
what she did&mdash;I know how she&mdash;how she&mdash;<i>struck</i>
you in the face that time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, as if reminded of a trifle that he had
forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she&mdash;put her arms around your neck that
way <i>many</i> times while you were carrying her home?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' ></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She did <i>not</i>! Many times! why, she didn&rsquo;t do
it even once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at the gate&mdash;I saw her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing for a little while, only stood with
head bent, as if thinking it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t get very far with it,&rdquo; he said,
quite seriously. &ldquo;Anyway, she was asleep then, and
didn&rsquo;t know what she was doing. It was just the
subconscious reaching up of a falling, or dreaming,
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not a little amused, in a quick turn from
her serious bent of jealousy, at his long and careful
explanation of the incident. She laughed, and the
little green cloud that had troubled her blew away
on the gale of her mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said she, from her deep corner across
the bright oblong of the door, tossing it all away
from her. &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll go away and let us
come out after a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ve got any such intention.
If it doesn&rsquo;t come to a fight before then, I believe
we&rsquo;ll have to drive the horses out ahead of us after
dark, and try to get away under the confusion. You
should have gone on, Frances, when I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses were growing restive, moving, stamping,
snorting, and becoming quarrelsome together.
Macdonald&rsquo;s little range animal had a viciousness in
it, and would not make friends with the chestnut cavalry
horse. It squealed and bit, and even tried to
use its heels, at every friendly approach.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' ></a>220</span></div>
<p>Macdonald feared that so much commotion might
bring the shaky, rotten roof down on them. A hoof
driven against one of the timbers which supported
it might do the trick, and bring them to a worse end
than would the waiting bullets of Dalton and his
gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to risk putting that horse of yours over
on your side,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Stand ready to catch
him, but don&rsquo;t lean a hair past the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned the horse and gave it a slap. As it
crossed the bar of light falling through the door, a
shot cracked among the rocks. The bullet knocked
earth over him as it smacked in the facing of the
door. The man who had fired had shot obliquely,
there being no shelter directly in front, and that
fact had saved the horse.</p>
<p>Macdonald peered through his loophole. He could
not see the smoke, but he let them know that he was
primed by answering the shot at random. The shot
drew a volley, a bullet or two striking the rear wall
of the cave.</p>
<p>After that they waited for what might come between
then and night. They said little, for each
was straining with unpleasant thoughts and anxieties,
and put to constant watchfulness to keep the horses
from slewing around into the line of fire. Every time
a tail switched out into the streak of light a bullet
came nipping in. Sometimes Macdonald let them go
unanswered, and again he would spring up and drive
away at the rocks which he knew sheltered them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' ></a>221</span>
almost driven to the point of rushing out and trying
to dislodge them by storm.</p>
<p>So the day wore by. They had been in the dugout
since a little after sunrise. Sunset was pale on the
hilltops beyond them when Macdonald, his strained
and tired eyes to the loophole, saw Dalton and two
of his men slipping from rock to rock, drawing nearer
for what he expected to be the rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you shoot?&rdquo; he asked her, his mouth hot
and dry as if his blood had turned to liquid fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can shoot,&rdquo; she answered, steadily.</p>
<p>He tossed one of his revolvers across to her, dimly
seen now in the deepening gloom of the cave, and
flung a handful of cartridges after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re closing in on us for the rush, and I&rsquo;m
going to try to stop them. Keep back there where
you are, and hold your horse under cover as long as
you hear me shooting. If I stop first, call Dalton
and tell him who you are. I believe in that case he&rsquo;ll
let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help you,&rdquo; she said, rising resolutely.
&ldquo;When you&mdash;stop shooting&mdash;&rdquo; she choked
a little over the words, her voice caught in a dry little
sob&mdash;&ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll stop shooting, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay back there, Frances! Do you hear&mdash;stay
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody was on the roof of the dugout; under
his weight clods of earth fell, and then, with a soft
breaking of rotten timber, a booted foot broke
through. It was on Frances&rsquo; side, and the fellow&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' ></a>222</span>
foot almost touched her saddle as her frightened
horse plunged.</p>
<p>The man was tugging to drag his foot through the
roof now, earth and broken timber showering down.
Macdonald only glanced over his shoulder, as if
leaving that trapped one to her. He was set for
their charge in front. She raised her revolver to fire
as the other leg broke through, and the fellow&rsquo;s body
dropped into the enlarged hole. At that moment the
men in front fired a volley through the gaping door.
Frances saw the intruder drop to the ground, torn
by the heavy bullets from his companions&rsquo; guns.</p>
<p>The place was full of smoke, and the turmoil of
the frightened horses, and the noise of quick shots
from Macdonald&rsquo;s station across the door. She could
not make anything out in the confusion as she turned
from the dead man to face the door, only that Macdonald
was not at his place at the loophole now.</p>
<p>She called him, but her voice was nothing in the
sound of firing. A choking volume of smoke was
packing the cave. She saw Macdonald&rsquo;s horse lower
its head and dash out, with a whip of its tail like a
defiance of her authority. Then in a moment everything
was still out there, with a fearful suddenness.</p>
<p>She flung herself into the cloud of smoke that hung
in the door, sobbing Macdonald&rsquo;s name; she stumbled
into the fresh sweet air, almost blind in her anxiety,
and the confusion of that quickly enacted scene, her
head bent as if to run under the bullets which she
expected.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' ></a>223</span></div>
<p>She did not see how it happened, she did not know
that he was there; but his arm was supporting her,
his cool hand was on her forehead, stroking her face
as if he had plucked her drowning from the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; she asked, only to exclaim, and
shrink closer to him at the sight of one lying a few
rods away, in that sprawling limp posture of those
who fall by violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were only four of them&mdash;there the other
two go.&rdquo; He pointed down the little swale where the
tall grass was still green. Macdonald&rsquo;s horse had
fallen to grazing there, his master&rsquo;s perils and escapes
all one to him now. It threw its head up and stood
listening, trotted a little way and stopped, ears stiff,
nostrils stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody coming,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Chadron and a fresh gang, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to the dugout door, where Frances&rsquo;
horse stood with its head out inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump up&mdash;quick!&rdquo; he said, bringing the horse
out. &ldquo;Go this time, Frances; don&rsquo;t hang back a
second more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Alan,&rdquo; she said, from the other side
of the horse, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the cavalry&mdash;I guess they&rsquo;ve
come after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King was at the head of the detail of seven
men which rode up, horses a lather of sweat. He
threw himself from the saddle and hurried to Frances,
his face full of the liveliest concern. Macdonald
stepped around to meet him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' ></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven! you&rsquo;re not hurt,&rdquo; the major said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we thought we were in for another fight,&rdquo;
she told him, offering him her hand in the gratefulness
of her relief. He almost snatched it in his
eagerness, and drew her toward him, and stood holding
it in his haughty, proprietary way. &ldquo;Mr. Macdonald&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrels heard us coming and ran&mdash;we
got a glimpse of them down there. Chadron will
have to answer for this outrage!&rdquo; the major said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major King, this is Mr. Macdonald,&rdquo; said she,
firmly, breaking down the high manner in which the
soldier persisted in overlooking and eliminating the
homesteader.</p>
<p>Major King&rsquo;s face flushed; he drew back a hasty
step as Macdonald offered his hand, in the frank and
open manner of an equal man who raised no thought
nor question on that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;ve been hearing of the gallant <i>rescue</i> that
you made of another young lady this morning,&rdquo; he
said, with sneering emphasis. &ldquo;You are hardly the
kind of a man I shake hands with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troopers, sitting their blowing horses a rod
away, made their saddles creak as they shifted to see
this little dash of melodrama. Macdonald&rsquo;s face was
swept by a sudden paleness, as if a sickness had come
over him. He clenched his lean jaw hard; the firmness
of his mouth was grimmer still as his hand
dropped slowly to his side. Frances looked her
indignation and censure into Major King&rsquo;s hot eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' ></a>225</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Macdonald has defended me like a gallant
gentleman, sir! Those ruffians didn&rsquo;t run because
they heard you coming, but because he faced them
out here in the open, single-handed and alone, and
drove them to their horses, Major King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troopers were looking Macdonald over with
favor. They had seen the evidence of his stand
against Chadron&rsquo;s men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deceived in your estimation of the fellow,
Miss Landcraft,&rdquo; the major returned, red to
the eyes in his offended dignity. &ldquo;I arrived at the
ranch not an hour ago, detailed to escort you back
to the post. Will you have the kindness to mount
at once, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped forward to give her a hand into the
saddle. But Macdonald was before him in that
office, urged to it by the quick message of her eyes.
From the saddle she leaned and gave him her warm,
soft hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your men need you, Mr. Macdonald&mdash;go to
them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My prayers for your success in
this fight for the right will follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald was standing bareheaded at her stirrup.
Her hand lingered a moment in his, her eyes sounded
the bottom of his soul. Major King, with his little
uprising of dignity, was a very small matter in the
homesteader&rsquo;s mind just then, although a minute past
he had fought with himself to keep from twisting the
arrogant officer&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>She fell in beside Major King, who was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' ></a>226</span>
grim enough in his way now, in the saddle, and they
rode away. Macdonald stood, hat in hand, the last
sunbeams of that day over his fair tangled hair, the
smoke of his conflict on his face, the tender light of
a man&rsquo;s most sacred fire in his eyes.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>BOOTS AND SADDLES</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>When Major King delivered Frances&mdash;his
punctilious military observance made her
home-coming nothing less&mdash;to Colonel Landcraft,
they found that grizzled warrior in an electrical state
of excitement. He was moving in quick little charges,
but with a certain grim system in all of them, between
desk and bookcases, letter files, cabinets, and
back to his desk again. He drew a document here,
tucked one away there, slipped an elastic about others
assembled on his desk, and clapped a sheaf of
them in his pocket.</p>
<p>Major King saluted within the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honor to report the safe return of the
detachment dispatched to Alamito Ranch for the
convoy of Miss Landcraft,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft returned the salute, and stood
stiffly while his officer spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said he. Then flinging away his
official stiffness, he met Frances half-way as she ran
to meet him, and enfolded her to his breast, just as
if his dry old heart knew that she had come to him
through perils.</p>
<p>Breathlessly she told him the story, leaving no
word unsaid that would mount to the credit of Alan
Macdonald. Colonel Landcraft was as hot as blazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' ></a>228</span>
straw over the matter. He swore that he would
roast Saul Chadron&rsquo;s heart on his sword, and
snatched that implement from the chair where it
hung as he spoke, and buckled it on with trembling
hand.</p>
<p>King interposed to tell him that Chadron was not
at the ranch, and begged the colonel to delegate to
him the office of avenger of this insult and hazard
that Frances had suffered at the hands of his men.
For a moment Colonel Landcraft held the young
officer&rsquo;s eye with thankful expression of admiration,
then he drew himself up as if in censure for wasted
time, saluted, took a paper from his desk, and said
with grave dignity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must fall to you, Major King, to demand the
reparation for this outrage that I shall not be here
to enforce. I am ordered to Washington, sir, to
make my appearance before the retiring board. The
department has vested the command of this post in
you, sir&mdash;here is the order. My soldiering days
are at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the paper to Major King, with a salute.
With a salute the young officer took it from his hand,
an eager light in his eyes, a flush springing to his
pale face. Frances clung to her father&rsquo;s arm, a
little trembling moan on her lips as if she had received
a mortal hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, never mind, dear heart,&rdquo; said the
old man, a shake in his own voice. Frances, looking
up with her great pity into his stern, set face, saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' ></a>229</span>
a tear creeping down his cheek, toughened by the
fires of thirty years&rsquo; campaigns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never soldier any more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the politicians
have got me. They&rsquo;ve been after me a long
time, and they&rsquo;ve got me. But there is one easement
in my disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it on those terms, sir!&rdquo; implored
Major King, more a man than a soldier as he laid
a consoling hand on the old man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Frances, clinging to her father&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft smiled, looking from one to the
other of them, and a softness came into his face. He
took Major King&rsquo;s hand and carried it to join
Frances&rsquo;, and she, in her softness for her father,
allowed it to remain in the young soldier&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one gleam of joy in the sundown of my
life,&rdquo; the colonel said, &ldquo;and that is in seeing my
daughter pledged to a soldier. I must live in the
reflection of your achievements, if I live beyond this
disgrace, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to make them worthy of my mentor,
sir,&rdquo; Major King returned.</p>
<p>Frances stood with bowed head, the major still
holding her hand in his ardent grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crushing blow, to come before the preferment
in rank that I have been led to expect would
be my retiring compensation!&rdquo; The colonel turned
from them sharply, as if in pain, and walked in
marching stride across the room. Frances withdrew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' ></a>230</span>
her hand, with a little struggle, not softened by the
appeal in the major&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor wife is bowed under it,&rdquo; the colonel
spoke as he marched back and forth. &ldquo;She has hoped
with me for some fitting reward for the years of
service I have unselfishly given to my country, sir,
for the surrender of my better self to the army.
I&rsquo;ll never outlive it, I feel that I&rsquo;ll never outlive it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft had no thought apart from
what he felt to be his hovering disgrace. He had
forgotten his rage against Chadron, forgotten that
his daughter had lived through a day as hazardous as
any that he had experienced in the Apache campaigns,
or in his bleak watches against the Sioux.
He turned to her now, where she stood weeping softly
with bowed head, the grime of the dugout on her
habit, her hair, its bonds broken, straying over her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had counted pleasurably on seeing you two
married,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but something tells me I shall
never come back from this journey, never resume
command of this post.&rdquo; He turned back to his
marching, stopped three or four paces along, turned
sharply, a new light in his face. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
it be before I leave&mdash;tonight, within the hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; said Frances, in terrified voice,
lifting her face in its tear-wet loveliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must make the train that leaves Meander at
four o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning, I shall have to leave
here within&mdash;&rdquo; he flashed out his watch with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' ></a>231</span>
quick, nervous hand&mdash;&ldquo;within three-quarters of an
hour. What do you say, Major King? Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been ready at any time for two years,&rdquo;
Major King replied, in trembling eagerness.</p>
<p>Frances was thrown into such a mental turmoil by
the sudden proposal that she could not, at that moment,
speak a further protest. She stood with white
face, her heart seeming to shrivel, and fall away to
laboring faintness. Colonel Landcraft was not considering
her. He was thinking that he must have
three hours&rsquo; sleep in the hotel at Meander before the
train left for Omaha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall have the wedding at once, just
as you stand!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the chaplain
in and&mdash;go and tell your mother, child, and&mdash;oh,
well, throw on another dress if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances found her tongue as her danger of being
married off in that hot and hasty manner grew imminent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to marry Major King, father,
now or at any future time,&rdquo; said she, speaking slowly,
her words coming with coldness from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! you have nothing to say, nothing to do
but obey!&rdquo; Colonel Landcraft blazed up in sudden
explosion, after his manner, and set his heel down
hard on the floor, making his sword clank in its
scabbard on his thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not had much to say,&rdquo; Frances admitted,
bitterly, &ldquo;but I am going to have a great deal to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' ></a>232</span>
say in this matter now. Both of you have gone
ahead about this thing just as if I was irresponsible,
both of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, miss! I command you&mdash;hold
your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the farthest thing from my heart to give you
pain, or disappoint you in your calculations of me,
father,&rdquo; she told him, her voice gathering power, her
words speed, for she was a warrior like himself, only
that her balance was not so easily overthrown; &ldquo;but
I am not going to marry Major King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven and hell!&rdquo; said Colonel Landcraft,
stamping up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven <i>or</i> hell,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and not hell&mdash;if I
can escape it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not permit this insubordination in a member
of my family!&rdquo; roared the colonel, his face fiery, his
rumpled eyebrows knitted in a scowl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have obedience,
with good grace, and at once, or damn my
soul, you&rsquo;ll leave my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major King, if you are a gentleman, sir, you will
relieve me of this unwelcome pressure to force me
against my inclination. It is quite useless, sir, I tell
you most earnestly. I would rather die than marry
you&mdash;I would rather die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have no wish to coerce the lady&rdquo;&mdash;Major
King&rsquo;s voice shook, his words were low&mdash;&ldquo;as she
seems to have no preference for me, sir. Miss Landcraft
perhaps has placed her heart somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has no right to act with such treachery to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' ></a>233</span>
me and you, sir,&rdquo; the colonel said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have
it! Where else, sir&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me the humiliation of informing you,&rdquo;
begged Major King, with averted face, with sorrow
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you slanderous coward!&rdquo; Frances assailed
him with scorn of word and look. Colonel Landcraft
was shaking a trembling finger at her, his face thrust
within a foot of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have it! you&rsquo;ll not&mdash;who is the fellow,
who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to conceal, there is no humiliation
on my part in speaking his name, but pride&mdash;the
highest pride of my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood back from them a little, her lofty head
thrown back, her face full of color now, the strength
of defense of the man she loved in her brave brown
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some low poltroon, some sneaking civilian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a man, father&mdash;you have granted that.
His name is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; thundered the colonel. &ldquo;Heaven and
hell! Will you disgrace me by making public confession
of your shame? Leave this room, before you
drive me to send you from it with a curse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her room Frances heard the horses come to the
door to carry her father away. She had sat there,
trembling and hot, sorry for his foolish rage, hurt
by his narrow injustice. Yet she had no bitterness
in her heart against him, for she believed that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' ></a>234</span>
knew him best. When his passion had fallen he would
come to her, lofty still, but ashamed, and they would
put it behind them, as they had put other differences
in the past.</p>
<p>Her mother had gone to him to share the last
moments of his presence there, and to intercede for
her. Now Frances listened, her hot cheek in her
hand, her eyes burning, her heart surging in fevered
stroke. There was a good deal of coming and going
before the house; men came up and dismounted,
others rode away. Watching, her face against the
cool pane, she did not see her father leave. Yet he had
not come to her, and the time for his going was past.</p>
<p>Her heart was sore and troubled at the thought
that perhaps he had gone without the word of pacification
between them. It was almost terrifying to
her to think of that. She ran down the stairs and
stood listening at his closed door.</p>
<p>That was not his voice, that heavy growl, that
animal note. Saul Chadron&rsquo;s; no other. Her mother
came in through the front door, weeping, and clasped
Frances in her arms as she stood there, shadowy in
the light of the dim hall lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Frances did not speak. But for the first time in
her life a feeling of bitterness against her father for
his hardness of heart and unbending way of injustice
lifted itself in her breast. She led her mother to her
own room, giving her such comfort as she could put
into words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' ></a>235</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He said he never marched out to sure defeat before,&rdquo;
Mrs. Landcraft told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him go
many a time, Frances, but never with such a pain
in my heart as tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Saul Chadron was the man who had caused
his going, Frances knew, a new illumination having
come over the situation since hearing his voice in the
colonel&rsquo;s office a few minutes past. Chadron had been
at Meander, telegraphing to the cattlemen&rsquo;s servants
in Washington all the time. He had demanded the
colonel&rsquo;s recall, and the substitution of Major King,
because he wanted a man in authority at the post
whom he could use.</p>
<p>This favoritism of Chadron made her distrustful
at once of Major King. There must be some scheming
and plotting afoot. She went down and stood in
the hall again, not even above bending to listen at the
keyhole. Chadron was talking again. She felt that
he must have been talking all the time that she had
been away. It must be an unworthy cause that
needed so much pleading, she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll not shoot, I tell you, King; he&rsquo;s too
smart for that. He&rsquo;ll have to be trapped into it. If
you&rsquo;ve got to have an excuse to fire on them&mdash;and
I can&rsquo;t see where it comes in, King, damn my neck
if I can&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to set a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; returned Major King, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much force are you authorized to use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The order leaves that detail to me. &lsquo;Sufficient
force to restore order,&rsquo; it says.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' ></a>236</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ort to take a troop, at the least,
King, and a cannon&mdash;maybe two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think artillery will be necessary, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, King, but I&rsquo;d hate like
hell to take you up there and have that feller lick you.
You don&rsquo;t know him like I do. I tell you he&rsquo;d lay
on his back and fight like a catamount as long as he
had a breath left in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you locate them in the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d have to wait up there somewheres
for daybreak. I&rsquo;m not just sure which ca&ntilde;on they
are in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence. Frances peeped through the
keyhole, but could see nothing except thick smoke
over bookcases and files.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll not want to dislodge them before daylight,
anyway,&rdquo; said King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Macdonald can back off without a fight, he&rsquo;ll
do it,&rdquo; Chadron declared, &ldquo;for he knows as well as
you and I what it&rsquo;d mean to fire on the troops. And
I want you to git him, King, and make sure you&rsquo;ve
got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends largely on whether the fellow can be
provoked into firing on us, Chadron. You think he
can be; so do I. But in case he doesn&rsquo;t, the best we
can do will be to arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would he be to me arrested, King?
I tell you I want his scalp, and if you bring that
feller out of there in a sack you&rsquo;ll come back a brigadier.
I put you where you&rsquo;re at. Well, I can put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' ></a>237</span>
you higher just as easy. But the purty I want for
my trouble is that feller&rsquo;s scalp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the sound of somebody walking about,
in quick, nervous strides. Frances knew that Major
King had got up from his usurped place at the desk&mdash;place
unworthily filled, this low intrigue with
Chadron aside, she knew&mdash;and was strutting in the
shadow of his promised glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me, Chadron; I&rsquo;ve got my own account
to square with that wolf of the range!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp little silence, in which Frances could picture
Chadron looking at King in his covert, man-weighing
way. Then Chadron went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;King, I&rsquo;ve noticed now and then that you seemed
to have a soft spot in your gizzard for that little
girl of mine. Well, I&rsquo;ll throw her in to boot if you
put this thing through right. Is it a go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hesitate to bargain for the young lady without
her being a party to the business,&rdquo; King replied,
whether from wisdom born of his recent experience,
or through lack of interest in the proposal Frances
could not read in his even, well-pitched voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;d jump at you like a bullfrog at red
flannel,&rdquo; Chadron assured him. &ldquo;I could put your
uniform on a wooden man and marry him off to the
best girl in seven states. They never think of lookin&rsquo;
under a soldier&rsquo;s vest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me, Mr. Chadron, and the uniform of
the United States army,&rdquo; returned King, with barely
covered contempt. &ldquo;Suppose we allow events to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' ></a>238</span>
shape themselves in regard to Miss Chadron. She&rsquo;ll
hardly be entertaining marriage notions yet&mdash;after
her recent experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron got up so quickly he overturned his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, sir! do you mean to intimate you
wouldn&rsquo;t have her after what she&rsquo;s gone through?
Well, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet through any man that says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hold yourself in, Chadron; there&rsquo;s no call for
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s cold contempt would have been like a lash
to a man of finer sensibilities than Saul Chadron. As
it was, Frances could hear the heavy cattleman
breathing like a mad bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you talk about my little girl, King, go as
easy as if you was carryin&rsquo; quicksilver in a dish. You
told me she was all right a little while ago, and I
tell you I don&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Chadron was as bright as a redbird when I
saw her this afternoon,&rdquo; King assured him, calmly.
&ldquo;She has suffered no harm at the hands of Macdonald
and his outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll dance in hell for that trick before the sun
goes down on another day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His big play for sympathy fell flat,&rdquo; said King,
with a contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much of
a crowd on hand when he arrived at the ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence. A little shifting of feet, a growl from
Chadron, and a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as for your proposal involving Miss Chadron,
I am honored by it,&rdquo; said King.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' ></a>239</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Any man would be!&rdquo; Chadron declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will just let it stand, waiting the lady&rsquo;s
sanction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brightened Chadron up. He moved about,
and there was a sound as if he had slapped the young
officer on the back in pure comradeship and open
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your scheme for drawin&rsquo; that feller into
firin&rsquo; on your men?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over as we go,&rdquo; said King.</p>
<p>A bugle lifted its sharp, electrifying note in the
barracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boots and saddles!&rdquo; Chadron said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we march at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE TRAIL OF THE COFFEE</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;You done right to come to the mission after me,
for I&rsquo;d ride to the gatepost of hell to turn a
trick agin Saul Chadron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo&rsquo;s voice had a quaver of earnestness in it
that needed no daylight to enforce. The pitchy
night made a bobbing blur of him as he rode his
quick-stepping little horse at Frances Landcraft&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you owe him one,&rdquo; Frances admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll pay him before mornin&rsquo; or it won&rsquo;t be
no fault of mine. That there little ten-cent-size
major he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; stopped you if he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; known you was
goin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he would have, Mr. Gibson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; said Banjo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banjo,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that sounds more comfortabler,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know for a minute who you meant,
that name&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; to be a stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t want a stranger along tonight,&rdquo;
said she, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, we don&rsquo;t. That there horse you&rsquo;re
ridin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a good one, as good as any in the cavalry,
even if he ain&rsquo;t as tall. He was an outlaw till Missus
Mathews tamed him down.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' ></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How did she do it&mdash;not break him like a bronco-buster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she done it like she tames Injuns and other
folks, by gentle words and gentler hands. Some
they&rsquo;ll tell you she&rsquo;s sunk down to the ways of Injuns,
clean out of a white man&rsquo;s sight in the dirt and doin&rsquo;s
of them dead-horse eatin&rsquo; &rsquo;Rapahoes. But I know
she ain&rsquo;t. She lets herself down on a level to reach
&rsquo;em, and git her hands under &rsquo;em so she can lift &rsquo;em
up, the same as she puts herself on my level when
she wants to reach me, or your level, or anybody&rsquo;s
level, mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her eyes and her soft ways tell you that, Banjo,
as plain as any words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s done ten times as much as that big-backed
buffalo of a preacher she&rsquo;s married to ever done for
his own people, or ever will. He&rsquo;s clim above &rsquo;em
with his educated ways; the Injun&rsquo;s ironed out of
that man. You can&rsquo;t reach down and help anybody
up, mom, if you go along through this here world
on stilts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well, Banjo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need both of your hands to hold your stilts,
mom; you ain&rsquo;t got even a finger to spare for a low-down
feller like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a low-down fellow, Banjo. Don&rsquo;t be
calling yourself names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was low-down enough to believe what they told
me about Macdonald shootin&rsquo; up Chance Dalton. I
believed it till Missus Mathews give me the straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' ></a>242</span>
of it. One of them Injun police fellers told her how
that job was put up, and how it failed to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Lassiter told me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode along in silence a long time after that.
Then Banjo&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope we don&rsquo;t bust out onto them cavalry
fellers too sudden and meet a flock of bullets. I&rsquo;d
never forgive the man that put a bullet through my
fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go slowly, and keep listening; I can tell
cavalry from cowboys as far as I can hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet a purty you can, brought up with &rsquo;em like
you was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not be able to do anything before daylight,
and when we overtake them we&rsquo;ll ride around
and get ahead while they&rsquo;re waiting for morning. I
don&rsquo;t know where the homesteaders are, but they&rsquo;ll
be sending out scouts to locate them, and we can
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were following the road that the cavalry
had taken an hour in advance of them. Listening
now, they rode on without words. Now and then a
bush at the roadside flipped a stirrup, now and again
Banjo&rsquo;s little horse snorted in short impatience, as
if expressing its disapproval of this journey through
the dark. Night was assertive in its heaviness, but
communicative of its mysteries in its wild scents&mdash;the
silent music of its hour.</p>
<p>There are those who, on walking in the night, can
tell the hour by the smell, the taste, the elusive fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' ></a>243</span>
aroma of the quiet air. Before midnight it is like
a new-lit censer; in the small hours the smell of old
camp fires comes trailing, and the scent of rain upon
embers.</p>
<p>But Frances Landcraft was not afraid of the night
as she rode silently through it with Banjo Gibson at
her side. There was no shudder in it for her as there
had been on the night that Nola was stolen; it could
not have raised up a terror grim enough to turn her
back upon the road.</p>
<p>Her one thought was that she must reach Macdonald
before Chadron and King could find him, and
tell him that the troops were coming, and that he was
to be trapped into firing upon them. She knew that
many lives depended upon her endurance, courage,
and strategy; many lives, but most of all Alan Macdonald&rsquo;s
life. He must be warned, at the cost of her
own safety, her own life, if necessary.</p>
<p>To that end the troops must be followed, and a
desperate dash at daylight must be made into Macdonald&rsquo;s
camp. Perhaps it would be a race with the
cavalry at the last moment.</p>
<p>Banjo said it was beginning to feel like morning.
An hour past they had crossed the river at the ford
near Macdonald&rsquo;s place, and the foothills stood rough
and black against the starry horizon. They were
near them now, so near that the deeper darkness of
their timbered sides fell over them like a cold shadow.</p>
<p>Suddenly she checked Banjo with a sharp word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard them!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' ></a>244</span></div>
<p>Banjo&rsquo;s little horse, eager for the fellowship of its
kind as his master was for his own in his way, threw
up its head and whinnied. Banjo churned it with his
heels, slapped it on the side of the head, and shut
off the shrill call in a grunt, but the signal had gone
abroad. From the blackness ahead it was answered,
and the slow wind prowling down from the hills
ahead of dawn carried the scent of cigarettes to them
as they waited breathlessly for results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dismounted, and waiting for daylight,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;We must ride around them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were leaving the road, the low brush rasping
harshly on their stirrups&mdash;as loud as a bugle-call,
it seemed to Frances&mdash;when a dash of hoofs from
ahead told that a detachment was coming to investigate.
Now there came a hail. Frances stopped;
Banjo behind her whispered to know what they
should do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep that little fool horse still!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Now the patrol, which had stopped to hail, was
coming on again. Banjo&rsquo;s horse was not to be
sequestered, nor his craving for companionship in
that lonesome night suppressed. He lifted his shrill
nicker again, and a shot from the outriders of cavalry
was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer them, tell them who you are Banjo&mdash;they
all know you&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll slip away. Good-bye,
and thank you for your brave help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, they&rsquo;ll hear one as much as
they&rsquo;ll hear two.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' ></a>245</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you can help me much better by doing as
I tell you. Tell them that a led horse got away from
you, and that&rsquo;s the noise of it running away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for no more words, for the patrol was
very near, and now and then one of them fired as he
rode. Banjo yelled to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellers! Stop that fool shootin&rsquo; around
here, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banjo, you darned fool! And I tell you right
now, pardner, the first man that busts my fiddle with
a bullet&rsquo;ll have to mix with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldiers came up laughing, and heard Banjo&rsquo;s
explanation of the horse, still dimly heard, galloping
off. Frances stopped to listen. Presently she heard
them coming on again, evidently not entirely satisfied
with Banjo&rsquo;s story. But the parley with him had
delayed them; she had a good lead now.</p>
<p>In a little swale, where the greasewood reached
above her head, she stopped again to listen. She
heard the troopers beating the bushes away off to one
side, and knew that they soon would give it up. When
they passed out of her hearing, she rode on, slowly,
and with caution.</p>
<p>She was frontiersman enough to keep her direction
by the north star&mdash;Colonel Landcraft had seen to
that particular of her education himself&mdash;but Polaris
would not tell her which way to go to find Alan Macdonald
and his dusty men standing their vigil over
their cooped-up enemies. Nothing but luck, she knew,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' ></a>246</span>
could lead her there, for she was in a sea of sage-brush,
with the black river valley behind her, the
blacker hills ahead, and never a mark of a trail to
follow anywhere.</p>
<p>She had rounded the cavalry troop and left it far
behind; the silence which immersed the sleeping land
told her this. No hoof but her own mount&rsquo;s beat
the earth within sound, no foot but hers strained
saddle-leather within reach of her now, she believed.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do; ride slowly in the
direction that she had been holding with Banjo, and
keep eyes, ears, and nose all on the watch. The ways
of the range were early; if there was anybody within
a mile of her to windward she would smell the smoke
of his fire when he lit it, and see the wink of it, too,
unless he built it low.</p>
<p>But it was neither the scent of fire nor the red eye
of it winking on the hill that at length gave her despairing
heart a fresh handful of hope&mdash;nothing less
indeed than the aroma of boiling coffee. It had such
a feeling of comfort and welcome, of domesticity and
peace in it that she felt as if she approached a door
with a friend standing ready to take her horse.</p>
<p>Her horse was not insensible to the cheer that
somebody was brewing for himself in that wild place.
She felt him quicken under her, and put up his head
eagerly, and go forward as if he was nearing home.
She wondered how far the smell of coffee would carry,
and subsequent experience was a revelation on that
point.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' ></a>247</span></div>
<p>She had entered the hills, tracking back that
wavering scent of coffee, which rose fresh and sudden
now, and trailed away the next moment to the mere
color of a smell. Now she had it, now she lost it,
as she wound over rugged ridges and through groves
of quaking-asp and balm of Gilead trees, always
mounting among the hills, her eager horse taking the
way without guidance, as keen on the scent as she.</p>
<p>It must have taken her an hour to run down that
coffee pot. Morning was coming among the fading
stars when she mounted a long ridge, the quick striding
of her horse indicating that there was something
ahead at last, and came upon the camp fire, the
coffee, and the cook, all beside a splintered gray rock
that rose as high as a house out of the barrenness
of the hill.</p>
<p>The coffee-maker was a woman, and her pot was of
several gallons&rsquo; capacity. She was standing with
the cover of the boiler in one hand, a great spoon in
the other, her back half bent over her beverage, in
the position that the sound of Frances&rsquo; coming had
struck her. She did not move out of that alert pose
of suspicion until Frances drew rein within a few
feet of her and gave her good-morning. When the
poor harried creature saw that the visitor was a
woman, her fright gave place to wonder.</p>
<p>Frances introduced herself without parley, and
made inquiry for Macdonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless your heart, you don&rsquo;t aim to tell me
you rode all the way from the post in the night by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' ></a>248</span>
yourself?&rdquo; the simple, friendly creature said.
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Macdonald and most of the men they&rsquo;ve
left to take them scoun&rsquo;rels sent in here by the cattlemen
to murder all of us over to the jail at Meander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have they been gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not so very long. I reckon you must &rsquo;a&rsquo;
missed meetin&rsquo; &rsquo;em by a hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to catch up with them, right away! Is
there anybody here that can guide me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son can, and he&rsquo;ll be glad. He&rsquo;s just went
to sleep back there in the tent after guardin&rsquo; them
fellers all night. I&rsquo;ll roust him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pioneer woman came back almost at once, and
pressed a cup of her coffee upon Frances. Frances
took the tin vessel eagerly, for she was chilled from
her long ride. Then she dismounted to rest her horse
while her guide was getting ready, and warm her
numb feet at the fire. She told the woman how the
scent of her coffee had led her out of her groping like
a beacon light on the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about three miles from here down to the
valley,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;Coffee will carry on the
mornin&rsquo; air that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your son&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the woman replied.</p>
<p>The boy came around the rock, leading a horse.
He was wide awake and alert, bare-footed, bareheaded,
and without a coat. He leaped nimbly onto
his bare-backed beast, and Frances got into her saddle
as fast as her numb limbs would lift her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' ></a>249</span></div>
<p>As she road away after the recklessly riding youth,
she felt the hope that she had warmed in her bosom
all night paling to a shadow. It seemed that, circumstances
were ranging after a chart marked out
for them, and that her own earnest effort to interfere
could not turn aside the tragedy set for the
gray valley below her.</p>
<p>Morning was broadening now; she could see her
guide distinctly even when he rode many rods ahead.
Dawn was the hour for treacherous men and deeds
of stealth; Chadron would be on the way again before
now, with the strength of the United States
behind him to uphold his outlawed hand.</p>
<p>When they came down into the valley there was
a low-spreading mist over the gray sage, which lent
a warmth to the raw morning wind. There was a
sense of indistinctness through the mist which was
an ally to Chadron. Ten rods away, even in the
growing morning, it would have been impossible to
tell a cowboy from a cavalryman.</p>
<p>Here a haystack smoldered in what had been a
farmstead yard; its thin blue smoke wavered up in
the morning, incense over the dead hope of the humble
heart that had dreamed it had found a refuge
in that spot. At the roadside a little farther on the
burned ruins of a cabin lay. It had stood so near the
wheel track that the heat of its embers was warm on
Frances&rsquo; face as she galloped by. The wire fence
was cut between each post, beyond splicing or repair;
the shrubs which some home-hungry woman had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' ></a>250</span>
set in her dooryard were trampled; the well curb was
overthrown.</p>
<p>Over and over again as they rode that sad picture
was repeated. Destruction had swept the country,
war had visited it. Side by side upon the adjoining
lines many of the homesteaders had built their little
houses, for the comfort of being near their kind. In
the corner of each quarter section on either side of
the road along the fertile valley, a little home had
stood three days ago. Now all were gone, marked
only by little heaps of embers which twinkled a dying
glow in the breath of the morning wind.</p>
<p>Day was spreading now. From the little swells
in the land as she mounted them Frances could see
the deeper mist hovering in the low places, the tops
of tall shrubs and slender quaking-asp showing above
it as if they stood in snow. The band of sunrise
was broadening across the east; far down near the
horizon a little slip of lemon-rind moon was faltering
out of sight.</p>
<p>But there was no sight, no sound, of anybody in
the road ahead. She spurred up beside her guide and
asked him if there was any other way that they might
have taken. No, he said; they would have to go
that way, for there was only one fordable place in
the river for many miles. He pointed to the road,
fresh-turned by many hoofs, and clamped his lean
thighs to his bare horse, galloping on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a cut acrosst here, and maybe head
&rsquo;em off,&rdquo; he said, dashing away through the stirrup-high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' ></a>251</span>
sage, striking close to the hills again, and into
rougher going.</p>
<p>The ache of the most intense anxiety that she ever
had borne was upon Frances; hope was only a shred
in her hand. She believed now that all her desperate
riding must come to nothing in the end.</p>
<p>She never had been that long in the saddle before
in her life. Her body was numb with cold and
fatigue; she felt the motion of her horse, heard its
pounding feet in regular beat as it held to its long,
swinging gallop, but with the detached sense of being
no party to it. All that was sharp in her was the
pain of her lost struggle. For she expected every
moment to hear firing, and to come upon confusion
and death at the next lift of the hill.</p>
<p>In their short cut across the country they had
mounted the top of a long, slender ridge, which
reached down into the valley like a finger. Now her
guide pulled up his horse so suddenly that it slid
forward on stiff legs, its hoofs plowing the loose shale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go back&mdash;there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a
fight!&rdquo; he said, a look of shocked concern in his big
wild eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see them? Where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo;&mdash;he clutched her arm, leaning
and pointing&mdash;&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a bunch of fellers comin&rsquo;
to meet &rsquo;em that they don&rsquo;t see! I tell you there&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to be a fight!&rdquo;</p></div>
<hr class='pb' />

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>&ldquo;I BEAT HIM TO IT&rdquo;</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>The last dash of that long ride was only a whirlwind
of emotions to Frances. It was a red
streak. She did not know what became of the boy;
she left him there as she lashed her horse past him
on the last desperate stretch.</p>
<p>The two forces were not more than half a mile
apart, the cavalry just mounting at the ruins of a
homestead where she knew they had stopped for
breakfast at the well. A little band of outriders
was setting off, a scouting party under the lead of
Chadron, she believed. Macdonald&rsquo;s men, their
prisoners under guard between two long-strung lines
of horsemen, were proceeding at a trot. Between the
two forces the road made a long curve. Here it was
bordered by brushwood that would hide a man on
horseback.</p>
<p>When Frances broke through this screen which had
hidden the cavalry from Macdonald, she found the
cavalcade halted, for Macdonald had seen her coming
down the hill. She told him in few words what her
errand to him was, Tom Lassiter and those who rode
with him at the head of the column pressing around.</p>
<p>The question and mystification in Macdonald&rsquo;s
face at her coming cleared with her brisk words.
There was no wonder to him any more in her being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' ></a>253</span>
there. It was like her to come, winging through the
night straight to him, like a dove with a message.
If it had been another woman to take up that brave
and hardy task, then there would have been marvel
in it. As it was, he held out his hand to her, silently,
like one man to another in a pass where words alone
would be weak and lame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for Chadron to come with help
and attempt a rescue, and I was moving to forestall
him, but we were late getting under way. They&rdquo;&mdash;waving
his hand toward the prisoners&mdash;&ldquo;held out
until an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must think, and think fast!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going ahead to meet them, and offer to
turn these prisoners over to Major King. They&rsquo;ll
have no excuse for firing on us then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! some other way&mdash;think of some other
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked gravely into her anxious, pleading eyes.
&ldquo;Why, no matter, Frances. If they&rsquo;ve come here to
do that, they&rsquo;ll do it, but this way they&rsquo;ll have to
do it in the open, not by a trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald turned to Lassiter in a few hurried
words. She pressed to his side as the two rode away
alone to meet the troops, repeating as if she had
been denied:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' ></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dash of hoofs behind them, and a
man who rode like a sack of bran came bouncing up,
excitement over his large face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Macdonald&mdash;where&rsquo;re you off to?&rdquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>Macdonald told him in a word, riding forward as
he spoke. He introduced the stranger as a newspaper
correspondent from Chicago, who had arrived
at the homesteaders&rsquo; camp the evening past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they got troops, did they?&rdquo; the newspaper
man said, riding forward keenly. &ldquo;Yes, they told
me down in Cheyenne they&rsquo;d put that trick through.
Here they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdonald spurred ahead, holding up his right
hand in the Indian sign of peace. Major King
was riding with Chadron at the head of the vanguard.
They drew rein suddenly at sight of what appeared
to be such a formidable force at Macdonald&rsquo;s back,
for at that distance, and with the dimness of the
scattering mist, it appeared as if several hundred
horsemen were approaching.</p>
<p>Distrustful of Chadron, fearing that he might induce
Major King to shoot Macdonald down as he
sat there making overtures of peace, Frances rode
forward and joined him, the correspondent coming
jolting after her in his horn-riding way. After a
brief parley among themselves Chadron and King,
together with three or four officers, rode forward.
One remained behind, and halted the column as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' ></a>255</span>
came around the brushwood screen at the turn of
the road.</p>
<p>Major King greeted Frances as he rode up,
scowling in high dignity. Chadron could not cover
his surprise so well as Major King at seeing her
there, her horse in a sweat, her habit torn where the
brambles had snatched at her in her hard ride to get
ahead of the troops. He gave her a cold good-morning,
and sat in the attitude of a man pricking up his
ears as he leaned a little to peer into the ranks of
the force ahead.</p>
<p>The homesteaders had come to a halt a hundred
yards behind Macdonald; about the same distance
behind Major King and his officers the cavalry had
drawn up across the road. Major King sat in
brief silence, as if waiting for Macdonald to begin. He
looked the homesteader captain over with severe eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were starting for Meander, Major King, to
deliver to the sheriff fifty men whom we have taken
in the commission of murder and arson,&rdquo; Macdonald
replied, with dignity. &ldquo;Up to a few minutes ago
we had no information that martial law had superseded
the civil in this troubled country, but since
that is the case, we will gladly turn our prisoners
over to you, with the earnest request that they be
held, collectively and individually, to answer for the
crimes they have committed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s my men, King&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em there!&rdquo;
said Chadron, boiling over the brim.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' ></a>256</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This expedition has come to the relief of certain
men, attacked and surrounded in the discharge of
their duty by a band of cattle thieves of which you
are the acknowledged head,&rdquo; replied Major King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have come on a mistaken errand, sir,&rdquo;
Macdonald told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come into this lawless country to restore
order and insure the lives and safety of property of
the people to whom it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence of these hired raiders&rsquo; crimes lies
all around you, Major King,&rdquo; Macdonald said.
&ldquo;These men swept in here in the employ of the cattle
interests, burned these poor homes, and murdered
such of the inhabitants as were unable to fly to safety
in the hills ahead of them. We are appealing to the
law; the cattlemen never have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Soldier, let me tell you something&rdquo;&mdash;the
newspaper correspondent, to whom one man&rsquo;s
dignity was as much as another&rsquo;s, kicked his horse
forward&mdash;&ldquo;these raiders that bloody-handed Chadron
sent in here have murdered children and women,
do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in the hell are you?&rdquo; Chadron demanded,
bristling with rage, whirling his horse to face him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Chadron,&rdquo; Macdonald said, a little flash
of humor in his eyes over Chadron&rsquo;s hearing the truth
about himself from an unexpected source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve run into you, Chadron; I&rsquo;ve
got a little list of questions to ask you,&rdquo; the correspondent
told him, far from being either impressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' ></a>257</span>
or cowed. &ldquo;Neel is my name, of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,
I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d just as well keep your questions for another
day&mdash;you&rsquo;ll send nothing out of here!&rdquo; said
Major King, sharply.</p>
<p>Neel looked across his nose at King with triumphant
leer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent out something, Mr. Soldier-man,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;it was on the wire by midnight last night, rushed
to Meander by courier, and it&rsquo;s all over the country
this morning. It&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;ll give the other side
of this situation up here to the war department, and
it&rsquo;ll make this whole nation climb up on its hind legs
and howl. Murder? Huh, murder&rsquo;s no name for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron was growling something below his breath
into King&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-three men and boys&mdash;look at them, there
they are&mdash;rounded up fifty of the cutthroats the
Drovers&rsquo; Association rushed up here from Cheyenne
on a special train to wipe the homesteaders out,&rdquo;
Neel continued, rising to considerable heat in the
partisanship of his new light. &ldquo;Five dollars a day
was the hire of that gang, and five dollars bonus for
every man, woman, or baby that they killed! Yes,
I&rsquo;ve got signed statements from them, Chadron, and
I&rsquo;d like to know what you&rsquo;ve got to say, if anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disarm that rabble,&rdquo; said Major King, speaking
to a subordinate officer, &ldquo;and take charge of the men
they have been holding.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' ></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I protest&mdash;&rdquo; Macdonald began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no words to waste on you!&rdquo; Major King
cut him off shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d play a slow hand on that line, King, and a
careful one, if I were you,&rdquo; advised Neel. &ldquo;If you
take these men&rsquo;s guns away from them they&rsquo;ll be at
the mercy of Chadron&rsquo;s brigands. I tell you, man, I
know the situation in this country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said King, in cold hauteur.</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s eyes were lighting with the glitter of revenge.
He sat grinding his bridle-reins in his gloved
hand, as if he had the bones of the nesters in his
palm at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will proceed, with the rescued party under
guard, to Meander,&rdquo; continued Major King to his
officer, speaking as if he had plans for his own employment
aside from the expedition. &ldquo;There, Mr.
Chadron will furnish transportation to return them
whence they came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll furnish&mdash;&rdquo; began Chadron, in amazement at
this unexpected turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transportation, sir,&rdquo; completed Major King, in
his cold way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men should be held to the civil authorities
for trial in this county, and not set free,&rdquo; Macdonald
protested, indignant over the order.</p>
<p>Major King ignored him. He was still looking
at Chadron, who was almost choking on his rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell! Do you mean to tell me the whole damn
thing&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to fizzle out this way, King? I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' ></a>259</span>
something done, I tell you&mdash;I want something done!
I didn&rsquo;t bring you up here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, sir!&rdquo; snapped King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders to you&mdash;&rdquo; Chadron flared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens that I am not marching under your
orders at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell you ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Chadron exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage on humanity to turn those
scoundrels loose, Major King!&rdquo; Neel said. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;ve got signed statements, I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove this man to the rear!&rdquo; Major King addressed
a lieutenant, who communicated the order to
the next lowest in rank immediately at hand, who
passed it on to two troopers, who came forward
briskly and rode the protesting correspondent off
between them.</p>
<p>Other troopers were collecting the arms of the
homesteaders, a proceeding which Macdonald witnessed
with a sick heart. Frances, sitting her horse
in silence through all that had passed, gave him what
comfort and hope she could express with her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detail a patrol of twenty men,&rdquo; Major King continued
his instructions to his officer, &ldquo;to keep the
roads and disarm all individuals and bands encountered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t apply to my men!&rdquo; declared Chadron,
positively. In his face there was a dark threat of
disaster for Major King&rsquo;s future hopes of advancement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It applies to everybody as they come,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' ></a>260</span>
King. &ldquo;Troops have come in here to restore order,
and order will be restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron was gaping in amazement. That feeling
in him seemed to smother every other, even his hot
rage against King for this sudden shifting of their
plans and complete overthrow of the cattlemen&rsquo;s expectations
of the troops. The one little comfort that
he was to get out of the expedition was that of seeing
his raiders taken out of Macdonald&rsquo;s hands and
marched off to be set free.</p>
<p>Macdonald felt that he understood the change in
King. The major had come there full of the intention
of doing Chadron&rsquo;s will; he had not a doubt of
that. But murder, even with the faint color of
excuse that they would have contrived to give it,
could not be done in the eyes of such a witness as
Frances Landcraft. Subserviency, a bending of
dignity even, could not be stooped to before one
who had been schooled to hold a soldier&rsquo;s honor his
most precious endowment.</p>
<p>Major King had shown a hand of half-fairness in
treating both sides alike. That much was to his
credit, at the worst. But he had not done it because
he was a high-souled and honorable man. His eyes
betrayed him in that, no matter how stern he tried
to make them. The coming of that fair outrider in
the night had turned aside a great tragedy, and saved
Major King partly to himself, at least, and perhaps
wholly to his career.</p>
<p>Macdonald tried to tell her in one long and earnest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' ></a>261</span>
look all this. She nodded, seeming to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve double-crossed me, King,&rdquo; Chadron accused,
in the flat voice of a man throwing down his
hand. &ldquo;I brought you up here to throw these nesters
off of our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The civil courts must decide the ownership of
that,&rdquo; returned King, sourly. &ldquo;Disarm that man!&rdquo;
He indicated Macdonald, and turned his horse as if
to ride back and join his command.</p>
<p>The lieutenant appeared to feel that it would be
no lowering of his dignity to touch the weapons of
a man such as Macdonald&rsquo;s bearing that morning had
shown him to be. He approached with a smile half
apologetic. Chadron was sitting by on his horse
watching the proceeding keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the officer, reaching out to
receive Macdonald&rsquo;s guns.</p>
<p>A swift change swept over Macdonald&rsquo;s face, a
flush dyeing it to his ears. He sat motionless a
little while, as if debating the question, the young
officer&rsquo;s hand still outstretched. Macdonald dropped
his hand, quickly, as if moved to shorten the humiliation,
to the buckle of his belt, and opened it with
deft jerk. At that moment Chadron, ten feet away,
slung a revolver from his side and fired.</p>
<p>Macdonald rocked in his saddle as Frances leaped
to the ground and ran to his side. He wilted forward,
his hat falling, and crumpled into her arms.
The lieutenant relieved her of her bloody burden,
and eased Macdonald to the ground.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' ></a>262</span></div>
<p>Major King came riding back. At his sharp command
troopers surrounded Chadron, who sat with
his weapon still poised, like one gazing at the mark at
which he had fired, the smoke of his shot around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a second he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; got me! but I beat him to it,
by God! I beat him to it!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Macdonald&rsquo;s belt had slipped free of his body.
With its burden of cartridges and its two long pistols
it lay at Frances&rsquo; feet. She stooped, a little sound
in her throat between a sob and a cry, jerked one of
the guns out, wheeled upon Chadron and fired. The
lieutenant struck up her arm in time to save the
cattleman&rsquo;s life. The blow sent the pistol whirling
out of her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will go off that way, sometimes,&rdquo; said the
young officer, with apology in his soft voice.</p>
<p>The soldiers closed around Chadron and hurried
him away. A moment Major King sat looking at
Macdonald, whose blood was wasting in the roadside
dust from a wound in his chest. Then he flashed a
look into Frances&rsquo; face that had a sneer of triumph
in it, wheeled his horse and galloped away.</p>
<p>In a moment the lieutenant was summoned, leaving
Frances alone between the two forces with Macdonald.
She did not know whether he was dead. She dropped
to her knees in the dust and began to tear frantically
at his shirt to come to the wound. Tom Lassiter
came hurrying up with others, denouncing the
treacherous shot, swearing vengeance on the cowardly
head that had conceived so murderous a thing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' ></a>263</span></div>
<p>Lassiter said that he was not dead, and set to work
to stem the blood. It seemed to Frances that the
world had fallen away from her, leaving her alone.
She stood aside a little, her chin up in her old imperious
way, her eyes on the far hills where the tender
sunlight was just striking among the white-limbed
aspen trees. But her heart was bent down to the
darkness of despair.</p>
<p>She asked no questions of the men who were working
so earnestly after their crude way to check that
precious stream; she stood in the activity of passing
troopers and escorted raiders insensible of any movement
or sound in all the world around her. Only
when Tom Lassiter stood from his ministrations and
looked at her with understanding in his old weary
eyes she turned her face back again, slowly resolute,
to see if he had died.</p>
<p>Her throat was dry. It took an effort to bring a
sound from it, and then it was strained and wavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, miss, he ain&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; Tom answered. But
there was such a shadow of sorrow and pain in his
eyes that tears gushed into her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom shook his head. &ldquo;The Lord that give him
alone can answer that,&rdquo; he said, a feeling sadness in
his voice.</p>
<p>The troops had moved on, save the detail singled
for police duty. These were tightening girths and
trimming for the road again a little way from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' ></a>264</span>
spot where Macdonald lay. The lieutenant returned
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Landcraft, I am ordered to convey you to
Alamito Ranch&mdash;under guard,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Banjo Gibson, held to be harmless and insignificant
by Major King, had been set free. Now he came up,
leading his horse, shocked to the deepest fibers of
his sensitive soul by the cowardly deed that Saul
Chadron had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It went clean through him!&rdquo; he said, rising from
his inspection of Macdonald&rsquo;s wound. And then,
moved by the pain in Frances&rsquo; tearless eyes, he enlarged
upon the advantages of that from a surgical
view. &ldquo;The beauty of a hole in a man&rsquo;s chest like
that is that it lets the pizen dreen off,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me none to see Mac up and
around inside of a couple of weeks, for he&rsquo;s as hard
as old hick&rsquo;ry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to Alamito Ranch and leave
him out here to die of neglect, orders or no orders!&rdquo;
said she to the lieutenant.</p>
<p>The young officer&rsquo;s face colored; he plucked at his
new mustache in embarrassment. Perhaps the prospect
of carrying a handsome and dignified young lady
in his arms for a matter of twenty-odd miles was not
as alluring to him as it might have been to another,
for he was a slight young man, only a little while
out of West Point. But orders were orders, and
he gave Frances to understand that in diplomatic
and polite phrasing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' ></a>265</span></div>
<p>She scorned him and his veneration for orders,
and turned from him coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no doctor with your detachment?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone on with the main body, Miss Landcraft.
They have several wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wounded murderers and burners of homes! Well,
I&rsquo;m not going to Alamito Ranch with you, sir, unless
you can contrive an ambulance of some sort and take
this gentleman too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer brightened. He believed it could be
arranged. Inside of an hour he had Tom Lassiter
around with a team and spring wagon, in which the
homesteaders laid Macdonald tenderly upon a bed
of hay.</p>
<p>Banjo waited until they were ready to begin their
slow march to the ranch, when he led his little horse
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on to the agency after the doctor and
send him over to Alamito as quick as he can go,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll see if Mother Mathews can go over,
too. She&rsquo;s worth four doctors when it comes to keep
the pizen from spreadin&rsquo; in a wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances gave him her benediction with her eyes,
and farewell with a warm handclasp, and Banjo&rsquo;s
beribboned horse frisked off on its long trip, quite
refreshed from the labors of the past night.</p>
<p>Frances was carrying Macdonald&rsquo;s cartridge belt
and revolvers, the confiscation of which had been
overlooked by Major King in the excitement of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' ></a>266</span>
shooting. The young lieutenant hadn&rsquo;t the heart
to take the weapons from her. Orders had been carried
out; Macdonald had been disarmed. He let it
go at that.</p>
<p>Frances rode in the wagon with Macdonald, a
canteen of water slung over her shoulders. Now and
then she moistened his lips with a little of it, and
bathed his eyes, closed in pathetic weariness. He
was unconscious still from the blow of Saul Chadron&rsquo;s
big bullet. As she ministered to him she felt that he
would open his eyes on this world&rsquo;s pains and cruel
injustices nevermore.</p>
<p>And why had Major King ordered her, virtually
under arrest, to Alamito Ranch, instead of sending
her in disgrace to the post? Was it because he
feared that she would communicate with her father
from the post, and discover to him the treacherous
compact between Chadron and King, or merely to
take a mean revenge upon her by humiliating her in
Nola Chadron&rsquo;s eyes?</p>
<p>He had taken the newspaper correspondent with
him, and certainly would see that no more of the
truth was sent out by him from that flame-swept
country for several days. With her at the ranch,
far from telegraphic communication with the world,
nothing could go out from her that would enlighten
the department on the deception that the cattlemen
had practiced to draw the government into the conflict
on their side. In the meantime, the Drovers&rsquo; Association
would be at work, spreading money with free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' ></a>267</span>
hand, corrupting evidence with the old dyes of falsehood.</p>
<p>Major King had seen his promised reward withdrawn
through her intervention, and had made a
play of being fair to both sides in the controversy,
except that he kept one hand on Chadron&rsquo;s shoulder,
so to speak, in making martyrs of those bloody men
whom he had sent there to burn and kill. They were
to be shipped safely back to their place, where they
would disperse, and walk free of all prosecution afterwards.
For that one service to the cattlemen Major
King could scarcely hope to win his coveted reward.</p>
<p>She believed that Alan Macdonald would die. It
seemed that the fever which would consume his feeble
hope of life was already kindling on his lips. But
she had no tears to pour out over him now. Only a
great hardness in her heart against Saul Chadron,
and a wild desire to lift her hand and strike him low.</p>
<p>Whether Major King would make her attempt
against Chadron&rsquo;s life, or her interference with his
military expedition his excuse for placing her under
guard, remained for the future to develop. She
turned these things in her mind as they proceeded
along the white river road toward the ranch.</p>
<p>It came noontime, and decline of sun; the shadow
of the mountains reached down into the valley, the
mist came purple again over the foothills, the fire
of sunset upon the clouds. Alan Macdonald still
lived, his strong harsh face turned to the fading
skies, his tired eyelids closed upon his dreams.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>LOVE AND DEATH</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Maggie and Alvino had the ranch to themselves
when the military party from the upper valley
arrived, Mrs. Chadron and Nola having driven to
Meander that morning. It had been their intention
to return that evening, Maggie said. Mrs. Chadron
had gone after chili peppers, and other things, but
principally chili peppers. There was not one left in
the house, and the mistress could not live without
them, any more than fire could burn without wood.</p>
<p>Dusk had settled when they reached the ranch,
and night thickened fast. The lieutenant dropped
two men at the corral gate&mdash;her guard, Frances understood&mdash;and
went back to his task of watching
for armed men upon the highroads.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Frances, Maggie had placed
a cot in Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s favored sitting-room with
the fireplace. There Macdonald lay in clean sheets,
a blaze on the hearth, and Maggie was washing his
wound with hot water, groaning in the pity which
is the sweetest part of the women of her homely race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that he will live, miss,&rdquo; she said hopefully.
&ldquo;See, he has a strong breath on my damp hand&mdash;I
can feel it like a little wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in her native tongue, which Frances understood
thoroughly from her years in Texas and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' ></a>269</span>
Arizona posts. Frances shook her head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid his breath will fail soon, Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, if they live the first hour after being shot,
they get well,&rdquo; Maggie persisted, with apparent sincerity.
&ldquo;Here, put your hand on his heart&mdash;do
you feel it? What a strong heart he has to live so
well! what a strong, strong heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a strong, strong heart!&rdquo; Tears were falling
for him now that there was none to see them, scalding
their way down her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have carried something sacred with him
to give him such strength, such life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He carried honor,&rdquo; said Frances, more to herself
than to Maggie, doubting that she would understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And love, maybe?&rdquo; said Maggie, with soft word,
soft upward-glancing of her feeling dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; Frances answered, turning her
head away.</p>
<p>Maggie drew the sheet over him and stood looking
down into his severe white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he could speak he would ask for his mother,
and for water then, and after that the one he loves.
That is the way a man&rsquo;s mind carries those three
precious things when death blows its breath in his
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Frances, slowly.</p>
<p>There was such stress in waiting, such silence in
the world, and such emptiness and pain! Reverently
as Maggie&rsquo;s voice was lowered, soft and sympathetic
as her word, Frances longed for her to be still, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' ></a>270</span>
go and leave her alone with him. She longed to hold
the dear spark of his faltering life in her own hands,
alone, quite alone; to warm it back to strength in her
own lone heart. Surely her name could not be the
last in his remembrance, no matter for the disturbing
breath of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will bring you some food,&rdquo; said Maggie. &ldquo;To
give him life out of your life you must be strong.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Frances started out of her sleep in the rocking-chair
before the fire. She had turned the lamp low,
but there was a flare of light on her face. Her
faculties were so deeply sunk in that insidious sleep
which had crept upon her like a bindweed upon wheat
that she struggled to rise from it. She sprang up,
her mind groping, remembering that there was something
for which she was under heavy responsibility,
but unable for a moment to bring it back to its place.</p>
<p>Nola was in the door with a candle, shading the
flame from her eyes with her hand. Her hair was
about her shoulders, her feet were bare under the
hem of her long dressing-robe. She was staring, her
lips were open, her breath was quick, as if she had
arrived after a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;alive?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you come to ask? What is his life to
you?&rdquo; asked Frances, sorrowfully bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Maggie just woke and came up to tell me,
mother doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;she&rsquo;s just gone to bed. Isn&rsquo;t
it terrible, Frances!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' ></a>271</span></div>
<p>Nola spoke distractedly, as if in great agony, or
great fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t harm any of you now, you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;
Frances was hard and scornful. She turned from
Nola and laid her hand on Macdonald&rsquo;s brow, drawing
her breath with a relieved sigh when she felt the
warmth of life still there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Frances, Frances!&rdquo; Nola moaned, with expression
of despair, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean it&rsquo;s terrible to have him here, I can&rsquo;t
help it. I&rsquo;m a prisoner, here against my will. I
couldn&rsquo;t leave him out there alone to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola lowered her candle and stared at Frances,
her eyes big and blank of everything but a wild expression
that Frances had read as fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you are to have your heartless way at last.
He will die, and his blood will be on this house, never
to be washed away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come back when we called you&mdash;both
of you?&rdquo; Nola drew near, reaching out an
appealing hand. Frances shrank from her, to bend
quickly over Macdonald when he groaned and moved
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put out that light&mdash;it&rsquo;s in his eyes!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Nola blew out the candle and came glimmering into
the room in her soft white gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me, Frances, don&rsquo;t blame any of us.
Mother and I wanted to save you both, we tried to
stop the men, and we could have held them back if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' ></a>272</span>
it hadn&rsquo;t been for Chance. Chance got three of them
to go, the others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They paid for that!&rdquo; said Frances, a little lift
of triumph in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chance didn&rsquo;t do it, I tell you! If he says he
did it he lies! It was&mdash;somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe&mdash;I saw one of them on guard
in front of the house as we came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s guarding me, I&rsquo;m under arrest, I tell you.
The soldiers have nothing to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola stood looking down at Macdonald, who was
deathly white in the weak light of the low, shaded
lamp. With a little timid outreaching, a little starting
and drawing back, she touched his forehead, where
a thick lock of his shaggy hair fell over it, like a sheaf
of ripe wheat burst from its band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it breaks my heart to see him dying&mdash;it&mdash;breaks&mdash;my&mdash;heart!&rdquo;
she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You struck him! You&rsquo;re not&mdash;you&rsquo;re not fit to
touch him&mdash;take your hand away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances pushed her hand away roughly. Nola
drew back, drenched with a sudden torrent of penitential
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, I know it!&rdquo; she confessed in bitterness,
&ldquo;I knew it when he took me away from those people
in the mountains and brought me home. He carried
me in his arms when I was tired, and sang to me as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' ></a>273</span>
we rode along there in the lonesome night! He sang
to me, just like I was a little child, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be
afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and you struck him, you struck him like a
dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suffered more for that than I hurt him,
Frances&mdash;it&rsquo;s been like fire in my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray to God it will burn up your wicked
pride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believed him, mother and I believed him, in
spite of what Chance said. Oh, if you&rsquo;d only come
back then, Frances, this thing wouldn&rsquo;t have happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what good that would have done,&rdquo; said
Frances, wearily; &ldquo;there are others who don&rsquo;t believe
him. They&rsquo;d have got him some time, just like
they got him&mdash;in a coward&rsquo;s underhanded way, never
giving him a chance for his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to Meander this morning thinking we&rsquo;d
catch father there before he left. We wanted to tell
him about Mr. Macdonald, and get him to drop this
feud. If we could have seen him I know he&rsquo;d have
done what we asked, for he&rsquo;s got the noblest heart in
the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Frances felt on the noble nature of Saul
Chadron she held unexpressed. She did not feel that
it fell to her duty to tell Nola whose hand had struck
Macdonald down, although she believed that the cattleman&rsquo;s
daughter deserved whatever pain and
humiliation the revelation might bring. For it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' ></a>274</span>
as plain as if Nola had confessed it in words that
she had much more than a friendly feeling of gratitude
for the foeman of her family.</p>
<p>Her heart was as unstable as mercury, it seemed.
Frances despised her for her fickleness, scorned her
for the mean face of friendship over the treachery of
her soul. Not that she regretted Major King. Nola
was free to take him and make the most of him. But
she was not to come in as a wedge to rive her from
this man.</p>
<p>Let her pay her debt of gratitude in something else
than love. Living or dead, Alan Macdonald was not
for Nola Chadron. Her penance and her tears, her
meanings and sobs and her broken heart, even that,
if it should come, could not pay for the humiliation
and the pain which that house had brought upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo; asked Nola, the gust of
her weeping past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it&mdash;how did it happen? You got away
from Chance&mdash;you said it wasn&rsquo;t Chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got away from that gang yesterday; this
happened this morning, miles from that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me, Frances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were standing at Macdonald&rsquo;s side. A little
spurt of flame among the ends of wood in the chimney
threw a sudden illumination over them, and played
like water over a stone upon Macdonald&rsquo;s face, then
sank again, as if it had been plunged in ashes.
Frances remained silent, her vindictiveness, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' ></a>275</span>
hardness of heart, against this vacillating girl dying
away as the flame had died. It was not her desire to
hurt her with that story of treachery and cowardice
which must leave its stain upon her name for many
a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of the man who shot him is a curse
and a blight on this land, a mockery of every holy
human thought. I&rsquo;ll not speak it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola stared at her, horror speaking from her eyes.
&ldquo;He must be a monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the lowest of the accursed&mdash;a coward!&rdquo;
Frances said.</p>
<p>Nola shuddered, standing silently by the couch a
little while. Then: &ldquo;But I want to help you, Frances,
if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that you can do. I&rsquo;m waiting
for Mrs. Mathews and the doctor from the agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go up and rest until they come, Frances,
you look so tired and pale. I&rsquo;ll watch by him&mdash;you
can tell me what to do, and I&rsquo;ll call you when they
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll stay until&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please go, Frances; you&rsquo;re nearly dead on
your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want me to leave him?&rdquo; Frances
asked, in a flash of jealous suspicion. She turned to
Nola, as if to search out her hidden intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were asleep in your chair when I came in,
Frances,&rdquo; Nola chided her, gently.</p>
<p>Again they stood in silence, looking down upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' ></a>276</span>
wounded man. Frances was resentful of Nola&rsquo;s interest
in him, of her presence in the room. She was
on the point of asking her to leave when Nola spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t been so proud, if he&rsquo;d only stooped
to explain things to us, to talk to us, even, this could
have been avoided, Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could he have said?&rdquo; Frances asked, wondering,
indeed, what explanation could have lessened
his offense in Saul Chadron&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had known him, I would have understood,&rdquo;
Nola replied, vaguely, in soft low voice, as if communing
with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! Well, perhaps&mdash;perhaps even you would
have understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;he moved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! your talking disturbs him, Nola. Go
to bed&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help me any here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave him all to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words flashed from Nola, as if they had sprung
out of her mouth before her reason had given them
permission to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course with me; he&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s going to die, Frances, can&rsquo;t I share him
with you till the end&mdash;can&rsquo;t I have just a little
share in the care of him here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola laid her hand on Frances&rsquo; arm as she pleaded,
turning her white face appealingly in the dim light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way, girl!&rdquo; said Frances,
roughly; &ldquo;you have no part in him at all&mdash;he is
nothing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' ></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He is all to me&mdash;everything to me! Oh,
Frances! If you knew, if you knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? If I knew what?&rdquo; Frances caught her
arm in fierce grip, and shook her savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;hurt me, Frances!&rdquo; Nola
cringed and shrank away, and lifted her arms as if
to ward a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you mean by that? Tell me&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the way it came to me, the way it came to
me as he carried me in his arms and sang to me so
I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; moaned Nola, her face hidden
in her hands. &ldquo;I never knew before what it was to
care for anybody that way&mdash;I never, never knew
before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have this man, nor any share in him,
living or dead! I gave up Major King to you; be
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Major King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor shadow that he is in comparison with a
man, he&rsquo;ll have to serve for you. Living or dead,
I tell you, this man is mine. Now go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola was shaking again with sudden gust of weeping.
She had sunk to the floor at the head of the
couch, a white heap, her bare arms clasping her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It breaks my heart to see him die!&rdquo; she moaned,
rocking herself in her grief like a child.</p>
<p>And child Frances felt her to be in her selfishness,
a child never denied, and careless and unfeeling of
the rights of others from this long indulgence. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' ></a>278</span>
doubted Nola&rsquo;s sincerity, even in the face of such
demonstrative evidence. There was no pity for her,
and no softness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; Frances spoke sternly&mdash;&ldquo;and go to
your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must not be allowed to die&mdash;he must be
saved!&rdquo; Nola reached out her hands, standing now
on her knees, as if to call back his struggling soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belated tears will not save him. Get up&mdash;it&rsquo;s
time for you to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola bent forward suddenly, her hair sweeping the
wounded man&rsquo;s face, her lips near his brow. Frances
caught her with a sound in her throat like a growl,
and flung her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not kiss him&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never kiss him!&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Nola sprang up, not crying now, but hot with
sudden anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were out of the way he&rsquo;d love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love <i>you!</i> you little cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;d love me&mdash;I&rsquo;d take him away from you
like I&rsquo;ve taken other men! He&rsquo;d love me, I tell you&mdash;he&rsquo;d
love <i>me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances looked at her steadily a moment, contempt
in her eloquent face. &ldquo;If you have no other
virtue in you, at least have some respect for the
dying,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dying, he&rsquo;ll not die!&rdquo; Nola hotly denied.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll live&mdash;live to love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go! This room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' ></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my house; I&rsquo;ll go and come in it when I
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prisoner in it, not a guest. I&rsquo;ll force you
out of the room if I must. This disgraceful behavior
must end, and end this minute. Are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were out of the way, he&rsquo;d love me,&rdquo; said
Nola from the door, spiteful, resentful, speaking
slowly, as if pressing each word into Frances&rsquo; brain
and heart; &ldquo;if you were out of the way.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE MAN IN THE DOOR</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>When the doctor from the agency arrived at
dawn, hours after Mrs. Mathews, he found
everything done for the wounded man that skill and
experience could suggest. Mrs. Mathews had carried
instruments, antiseptics, bandages, with her, and
she had no need to wait for anybody&rsquo;s directions in
their use. So the doctor, who had been reinforced
by the same capable hands many a time before, took
a cup of hot coffee and rode home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mathews moved about as quietly as a nun,
and with that humility and sense of self-effacement
that comes of penances and pains, borne mainly for
others who have fallen with bleeding feet beside the
way.</p>
<p>She was not an old woman, only as work and self-sacrifice
had aged her. Her abundant black hair&mdash;done
up in two great braids which hung in front
of her shoulders, Indian-wise, and wrapped at their
ends with colored strings&mdash;was salted over with
gray, but her beautiful small hands were as light
and swift as any girl&rsquo;s. Good deeds had blessed
them with eternal youth, it seemed.</p>
<p>She wore a gray dress, sprinkled over with twinkling
little Indian gauds and bits of finery such as the
squaws love. This barbaric adornment seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' ></a>281</span>
unaccountable in the general sobriety of her dress, for
not a jewel, save her wedding-ring alone, adorned her.
Frances did not marvel that she felt so safe in this
gentle being&rsquo;s presence, safe for herself, safe for the
man who was more to her than her own soul.</p>
<p>When the doctor had come and gone, Mrs.
Mathews pressed Frances to retire and sleep. She
spoke with soft clearness, none of that hesitation in
her manner that Frances had marked on the day
that they rode up and surrounded her where the
Indians were waiting their rations of beef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how it happened&mdash;who did it?&rdquo;
Frances asked. She was willing to leave him with
her, indeed, but reluctant to go until she had given
expression to a fear that hung over her like a threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banjo told me,&rdquo; Mrs. Mathews said, nodding her
graceful little head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that when Chadron comes home and
finds him here, he&rsquo;ll throw him out to die,&rdquo; Frances
whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s
pistols ready to&mdash;to&mdash;make a fight of it, if necessary.
Maybe you could manage it some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was on her knees beside her new friend,
her anxiety speaking from her tired eyes, full of
their shadows of pain. Mrs. Mathews drew her
close, and smoothed back Frances&rsquo; wilful, redundant
hair with soothing touch. For a little while she said
nothing, but there was much in her delicate silence
that told she understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Chadron will not do that,&rdquo; she said at last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' ></a>282</span>
&ldquo;He is a violent, blustering man, but I believe he
owes me something that will make him do in this case
as I request. Go to sleep, child. When he wakes
he&rsquo;ll be conscious, but too weak for anything more
than a smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances went away assured, and stole softly up
the stairs. The sun was just under the hill; Mrs.
Chadron would be stirring soon. Nola was up already,
Frances heard with surprise as she passed
her door, moving about her room with quick step.
She hesitated there a moment, thinking to turn back
and ask Mrs. Mathews to deny her the hospital room.
But such a request would seem strange, and it would
be difficult to explain. She passed on into the room
that she had lately occupied. Soothed by her great
confidence in Mrs. Mathews, she fell asleep, her last
waking hope being that when she stood before Alan
Macdonald&rsquo;s couch again it would be to see him
smile.</p>
<p>Frances woke toward the decline of day, with
upbraidings for having yielded to nature&rsquo;s ministrations
for so long. Still, everything must be progressing
well with Alan Macdonald, or Mrs. Mathews
would have called her. She regretted that she hadn&rsquo;t
something to put on besides her torn and soiled riding
habit to cheer him with the sight of when he
should open his eyes to smile.</p>
<p>Anxious as she was, and fast as her heart fluttered,
she took time to arrange her hair in the way that
she liked it best. It seemed warrant to her that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' ></a>283</span>
must find her handsomer for that. People argue that
way, men in their gravity as well as women in their
frivolity, each believing that his own appraisement
of himself is the incontestable test, none rightly understanding
how ridiculous pet foibles frequently
make us all.</p>
<p>But there was nothing ridiculous in the coil of
serene brown hair drawn low against a white neck,
nor in the ripples of it at the temples, nor in the
stately seriousness of the face that it shadowed and
adorned. Frances Landcraft was right, among
thousands who were wrong in her generation, in
her opinion of what made her fairer in the eyes of
men.</p>
<p>Her hand was on the door when a soft little step,
like a wind in grass, came quickly along the hall,
and a light hand struck a signal on the panel.
Frances knew that it was Mrs. Mathews before she
flung the door open and disclosed her. She was
dressed to take the road again, and Frances drew
back when she saw that, her blood falling away from
her heart. She believed that he stood in need of
her gentle ministrations no longer, and that she had
come to tell her that he was dead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mathews read her thought in her face, and
shook her head with an assuring smile. She entered
the room, still silent, and closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is far from dead,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;why are you leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little lady of the ranch has stepped into my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' ></a>284</span>
place&mdash;but you need not be afraid for yours.&rdquo; Mrs.
Mathews smiled again as she said that. &ldquo;He asked
for you with his first word, and he knows just how
matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color swept back over Frances&rsquo; face, and ran
down to hide in her bosom, like a secret which the
world was not to see. Her heart leaped to hear that
Maggie had been wrong in her application of the
rule that applies to men in general when death is
blowing its breath in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that little Nola isn&rsquo;t competent to take care
of him&mdash;she&rsquo;ll kill him if she&rsquo;s left there with him
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With kindness, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mathews, not
smiling now, but shaking her head in deprecation.
&ldquo;A surgeon is here, sent back by Major King, he
told me, and he has taken charge of Mr. Macdonald,
along with Miss Chadron and her mother. I have
been dismissed, and you have been barred from the
room where he lies. There&rsquo;s a soldier guarding the
door to keep you away from his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Nola&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; Frances nodded, her indignation
hot in her cheek, &ldquo;she thinks she can batter
her way into his heart if she can make him believe
that I am neglecting him, that I have gone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest easy, my dear, sweet child,&rdquo; counseled Mrs.
Mathews, her hand on Frances&rsquo; shoulder. &ldquo;Mr. Macdonald
will get well, and there is only one door to
his heart, and somebody that I know is standing in
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' ></a>285</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But he&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t understand; he&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ve
deserted him!&rdquo; Frances spoke with trembling lips,
tears darkling in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows how things stand; I had time to tell
him that before they ousted me. I&rsquo;d have taken time
to tell him, even if I&rsquo;d had to&mdash;pinch somebody&rsquo;s
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft-voiced little creature laughed when she
said that. Frances felt her breath go deeper into
her lungs with the relief of this assurance, and the
threatening tears came falling over her fresh young
cheeks. But they were tears of thankfulness, not of
suspense or pain.</p>
<p>Frances did not trouble the soldier at the door to
exercise his unwelcome and distasteful authority over
her. But she saw that he was there, indeed, as she
went out to give Mrs. Mathews farewell at the door.</p>
<p>Nola came pattering to her as she turned back in
the house again to find Maggie, for her young appetite
was clamoring. Nola&rsquo;s eyes were round, her
face set in an expression of shocked protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this an outrage, this high-handed business
of Major King&rsquo;s?&rdquo; She ran up all flushed and out
of breath, as if she had been wrestling with her
indignation and it had almost obtained the upper
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fresh tyranny is he guilty of?&rdquo; Frances
inquired, putting last night&rsquo;s hot words and hotter
feelings behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordering a soldier to guard the door of Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' ></a>286</span>
Macdonald&rsquo;s room, with iron-clad instructions to
keep you away from him! He sent his orders back
by Doctor Shirley&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it a petty piece of business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mathews told me. At least you could have
allowed her to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Nola&rsquo;s eyes seemed to grow. She gazed
and stared, injury, disbelief, pain, in her mobile expression.
&ldquo;Why, Frances, I didn&rsquo;t have a thing to
do with it, not a thing! Mother and I protested
against this military invasion of our house, but protests
were useless. The country is under martial
law, Doctor Shirley says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Major King know that Mr. Macdonald
had been brought here? He rode away without giving
any instructions for his disposal or care. I
believe he wanted him to die there where he fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he came to hear it, unless the
lieutenant here sent a report to him. But I ask you
to believe me, Frances&rdquo;&mdash;Nola put her hand on
Frances&rsquo; arm in her old wheedling, stroking way&mdash;&ldquo;when
I tell you I hadn&rsquo;t anything to do with it. In
spite of what I said last night, I hadn&rsquo;t. I was wild
and foolish last night, dear; I&rsquo;m sorry for all of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Frances said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, we&rsquo;ll take care of him, mother
and I. Major King&rsquo;s orders are that you&rsquo;re not to
leave this house, but I tell you, Frances, if I wanted
to go home I&rsquo;d go!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' ></a>287</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; returned Frances, with more meaning
in her manner of speaking than in her words.
&ldquo;Does Major King&rsquo;s interdiction extend to the commissary?
Am I going to be allowed to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie&rsquo;s got it all ready; I ran up to call you.&rdquo;
Nola slipped her arm round Frances&rsquo; waist and led
her toward the kitchen, where Maggie had the table
spread. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not mind the kitchen? The house
is so upset by those soldiers in it that we have no
privacy left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners and pensioners should eat in the
kitchen,&rdquo; Frances returned, trying to make a better
appearance of friendliness for Nola than she carried
in her heart.</p>
<p>Maggie was full of apologies for the poor service
and humble surroundings. &ldquo;It is the doings of
miss,&rdquo; she whispered, in her native sibilant Mexican,
when Nola found an excuse to leave Frances
alone at her meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Maggie; you eat in the
kitchen, both of us are women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and some saints&rsquo; images are made of lead,
some of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are all saints&rsquo; images, Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen will be brighter from this day,&rdquo;
Maggie declared, in the extravagant way of her race,
only meaning more than usually carries in a Castilian
compliment.</p>
<p>She backed away from the table, never having it
in her delicate nature to be so rude as to turn her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' ></a>288</span>
back upon her guest, and admired Frances from a
distance. The sun was reaching through a low window,
moving slowly up the cloth as if stealing upon
the guest to give her a good-night kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, miss!&rdquo; sighed Maggie, her hands clasped
as in adoration, &ldquo;no wonder that he lives with a well
in his body. He has much to live for, and that is
the truth from a woman&rsquo;s lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worth more because of its rarity, then, Maggie,&rdquo;
Frances said, warming over with blushes at
this ingenuous praise. &ldquo;Do they let you go into his
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is open to the servant,&rdquo; Maggie replied,
with solemn nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is closed to me&mdash;did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Miss tells you it is orders from some
captain, some general, some soldier I do not know
what&rdquo;&mdash;a sweeping gesture to include all soldiers,
great and small and far away&mdash;&ldquo;but that is a lie.
It came out of her own heart. She is a traitor to
friendship, as well as a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believed that from the beginning, Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house of deceit is not a place for me, for
even servant that I am, I am a true servant. But
I will not lie for a liar, nor be traitor for one who
deceives a friend. I shall go from here. Perhaps
when you are married to Mr. Macdonald you will
have room in your kitchen for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not build on shadows, Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is that Alvino, a cunning man in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' ></a>289</span>
garden. You should see how he charms the flowers
and vegetables&mdash;but you have seen, it is his work
here, all this is his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is ever a home of my own&mdash;if it ever
comes to that happiness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God hasten the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there will be room for both of you, Maggie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances rose from the table, and stood looking
though the window where the sun&rsquo;s friendly hand
had reached in to caress her a few minutes gone.
There was no gleam of it now, only a dull redness
on the horizon where it had fallen out of sight, the
red of iron cooling upon the anvil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four weeks he will be able to kneel at the altar
with you,&rdquo; said Maggie, making a clatter with the
stove lids in her excitement, &ldquo;and in youth that is
only a day. And I have a drawn piece of fine linen,
as white as your bosom, that you must wear over
your heart on that day. It will bring you peace,
far it was made by a holy sister and it has been
blessed by the bishop at Guadalupe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Maggie. If that day ever comes for
me, I will wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maggie came nearer the window, concern in her
homely face, and stood off a little respectful distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be with him, you should be there at
his side, and I will open the door for you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will?&rdquo; Frances started hopefully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' ></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Once inside, no man would lift a hand to put
you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how am I going to get inside, Maggie, with
that sentry at the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking how it could be done, miss.
Soon it will be dark, and with night comes fear.
Miss is with him now; she is there alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances turned to her, such pain in her face as
if she had been stabbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you go over that again? I know
it!&rdquo; she said, crossly. &ldquo;That has nothing to do
with my going into the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has much,&rdquo; Maggie declared, whispering now,
treasuring her plot. &ldquo;The old one is upstairs, sleeping,
and she will not wake until I shake her. Outside
the soldiers make their fires and cook, and
Alvino in the barn sings &lsquo;La Golondrina&rsquo;&mdash;you hear
him?&mdash;for that is sad music, like his soul. Very well.
You go to your room, but leave the door open to
let a finger in. When it is just creeping dark, and
the soldiers are eating, I will run in where the one
sits beside the door. My hair will be flying like the
mane of a wild mare, my eyes bi-i-i-g&mdash;so. In the
English way I will shout &lsquo;The rustlers, the rustlers!
He ees comin&rsquo;&mdash;help, help!&rsquo; When you hear this,
fly to me, quick, like a soul set free. The soldier at
the door will go to see; miss will come out; I will
stand in the door, I will draw the key in my hand.
Then you will fly to him, and lock the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Maggie! what a general you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' ></a>291</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Under the couch where he lies,&rdquo; Maggie hurried
on, her dark eyes glowing with the pleasure of this
manufactured romance, &ldquo;are the revolvers which he
wore, just where we placed them last night. I pushed
them back a little, quite out of sight, and nobody
knows. Strap the belt around your waist, and defy
any power but death to move you from the man you
love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie, you are magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Maggie shook her head, sadly, &ldquo;I am the
daughter of a peon, a servant to bear loads. But&rdquo;&mdash;a
flash of her subsiding grandeur&mdash;&ldquo;I would do
that&mdash;ah, I would have done that in youth&mdash;for
the man of my heart. For even a servant in the
back of a house has a heart, dear miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances took her work-rough hands in her own;
she pressed back the heavy black hair&mdash;mark of a
vassal race&mdash;from the brown forehead and looked
tenderly into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my sister,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Poor Maggie, quite overcome by this act of tenderness,
sank to her knees, her head bowed as if the
bell had sounded the elevation of the host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What benediction!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go now, and do as you have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it is a little more dark,&rdquo; said Maggie,
softly, looking after her tenderly as she went away.</p>
<p>Frances left her door ajar as Maggie had directed,
and stood before the glass to see if anything
could be done to make herself more attractive in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' ></a>292</span>
eyes. It did not seem so, considering the lack of
embellishments. She turned from the mirror sighing,
doubtful of the success of Maggie&rsquo;s scheme, but
determined to do her part in it, let the result be what
it might. Her place was there at his side, indeed;
none had the right to bar her his presence.</p>
<p>The joy of seeing him when consciousness flashed
back into his shocked brain had been stolen from
her by a trick. Nola had stood in her place then.
She wondered if that slow smile had kindled in his
eyes at the sight of her, or whether they had been
shadowed with bewilderment and disappointment.
It was a thing that she should never know.</p>
<p>She heard Mrs. Chadron leave her room and pass
heavily downstairs. Hope sank lower as she descended;
it seemed that their simple plot must fail.
Well, she sighed, at the worst it could only fail.
As she sat there waiting while twilight blended into
the darker waters of night, she reflected the many
things which had overtaken her in the two days
past. Two incidents stood out above all the haste,
confusion, and pain which gave her sharp regret.
One was that her father had parted from her to
meet his life&rsquo;s heaviest disappointment with anger and
unforgiving heart; the other that the shot which
she had aimed at Saul Chadron had been cheated of
its mark.</p>
<p>There came a trampling of hoofs from the direction
of the post, unmistakably cavalry. She strained
from the window to see, but it was at that period
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' ></a>293</span>
between dusk and dark when distant objects were
tantalizingly indefinite. Nothing could be made of
the number, or who came in command. But she believed
that it must be Major King&rsquo;s troops returning
from escorting the raiders to Meander.</p>
<p>Of course there would be no trying out of Maggie&rsquo;s
scheme now. New developments must come of the
arrival of Major King, perhaps her own removal to
the post. Surely he could not sustain an excuse that
she was dangerous to his military operations now.</p>
<p>Doors opened, and heavy feet passed the hall.
Presently all was a tangle of voices there, greetings
and warm words of welcome, and the sound of Mrs.
Chadron weeping on her husband&rsquo;s breast for joy at
his return.</p>
<p>Nola&rsquo;s light chatter rose out of the sound of the
home-coming like a bright thread in a garment, and
the genteel voice of Major King blended into the
bustle of welcome with its accustomed suave placidity.
Frances felt downcast and lonely as she listened
to them, and the joyous preparations for refreshing
the travelers which Mrs. Chadron was pushing forward.
They had no regard, no thought it seemed,
for the wounded man who lay with only the thickness
of a door dividing him from them.</p>
<p>She was moved with concern, also, regarding Chadron&rsquo;s
behavior when he should learn of Macdonald&rsquo;s
presence in that house. Would Nola have the courage
to own her attachment then, and stand between
the wrath of her father and his wounded enemy?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' ></a>294</span></div>
<p>She was not to be spared the test long. There
was the noise of Chadron moving heavily about, bestowing
his coat, his hat, in their accustomed places.
He came now into the dining-room, where the sentinel
kept watch at Macdonald&rsquo;s door. Frances crept
softly, fearfully, into the hall and listened.</p>
<p>Chadron questioned the soldier, in surprise.
Frances heard the man&rsquo;s explanation of his presence
before the door given in low voice, and in it the mention
of Macdonald&rsquo;s name. Chadron stalked away,
anger in the sound of his step. His loud voice now
sounded in the room where the others were still chattering
in the relief of speech after long silence. Now
he came back to the guarded door, Nola with him;
Mrs. Chadron following with pleading words and
moanings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead or alive, I don&rsquo;t care a damn! Out of this
house he goes this minute!&rdquo; Chadron said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, surely you wouldn&rsquo;t throw a man at
death&rsquo;s door out in the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Nola, lifting a trembling voice, and Frances
could imagine her clinging to his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not after what he&rsquo;s done for us, Saul&mdash;not after
what he&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron sounded almost
tearful in her pleading. &ldquo;Why, he brought Nola
home&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you know that, Saul? He brought
her home all safe and sound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he stole her to make that play!&rdquo; Chadron
said, either still deceived, or still stubborn, but in
any case full of bitterness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' ></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe that, father!&rdquo; Nola spoke
braver than Frances had expected of her. &ldquo;But
friend or enemy, common charity, common decency,
would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common hell! Git away from in front of that
door! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to throw his damned carcass out
of this house&mdash;I can&rsquo;t breathe with that man in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Saul, Saul! don&rsquo;t throw the poor boy out!&rdquo;
Mrs. Chadron begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I have to jerk you away from that door by
the hair of the head? Let me by, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances ran down stairs blindly, feeling that the
moment for her interference, weak as it might be,
and ineffectual, had come. Now Major King was
speaking, his voice sounding as if he had placed himself
between Chadron and the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better listen to your wife and
daughter, Chadron. The fellow can&rsquo;t harm anybody&mdash;let
him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter for the past, he&rsquo;s our guest, father,
he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell! Haven&rsquo;t they told you fool women the
straight of it yet? I tell you I had to shoot him to
save my own life&mdash;he was pullin&rsquo; a gun on me, but
I beat him to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Saul, my Saul!&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it you that&mdash;oh, was it you!&rdquo; There was
accusation, disillusionment, sorrow&mdash;and more than
words can define&mdash;in Nola&rsquo;s voice. Frances waited
to hear no more. In a moment she was standing in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' ></a>296</span>
the open door beside Nola, who blocked it against
her father with outstretched arms.</p>
<p>Chadron was facing his wife, his back to Frances
as she passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was me, and all I&rsquo;m sorry for is that I
didn&rsquo;t finish him on the spot. Here, you fellers&rdquo;&mdash;to
some troopers who crowded about the open door
leading to the veranda&mdash;&ldquo;come in here and carry
out this cot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t their day to take orders from Chadron;
none of them moved. Frances touched Nola&rsquo;s
arm; she withdrew it and let her pass.</p>
<p>Macdonald, alone in the room, had lifted himself
to his elbow, listening. Frances pressed him back
to his pillow with one hand, reaching with the other
under the cot for his revolvers. Her heart jumped
with a great, glad bound, as if it had leaped from
death to safety, when she touched the weapons. A
cold steadiness settled over her. If Saul Chadron
entered that room, she swore in her heart that she
would kill him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interfere with me, King,&rdquo; said Chadron,
turning again to the door, &ldquo;I tell you he goes, alive
or dead. I can&rsquo;t breathe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop where you are!&rdquo; Frances rose from her
groping under the cot, a revolver in her hand.</p>
<p>Chadron, who had laid hold of Nola to tear her
from the door, jumped like a man startled out of
his sleep. In the heat of his passion he had not
noticed one woman more or less.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' ></a>297</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; he said, catching himself as
his hand reached for his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances will take him away as soon as he&rsquo;s able
to be moved,&rdquo; said Nola, pleading, fearful, her eyes
great with the terror of what she saw in Frances&rsquo;
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;ll go with him, right now!&rdquo; Chadron
declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you just ten seconds to put down
that gun, or I&rsquo;ll come in there and take it away from
you! No damn woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud and impatient summons sounded on the
front door, drowning Chadron&rsquo;s words. He turned,
with an oath, demanding to know who it was.
Frances, still covering him with her steady hand,
heard hurrying feet, the door open, and Mrs. Chadron
exclaiming and calling for Saul. The man at the
door had entered, and was jangling his spurs through
the hall in hasty stride. Chadron stood as if frozen
in his boots, his face growing whiter than wounded,
blood-drained Macdonald&rsquo;s on his cot of pain.</p>
<p>Now the sound of the newcomer&rsquo;s voice rose in
the hall, loud and stern. But harsh as it was, and
unfriendly to that house, the sound of it made
Frances&rsquo; heart jump, and something big and warm
rise in her and sweep over her; dimming her eyes
with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my daughter, Chadron, you cutthroat!
Where&rsquo;s Miss Landcraft? If the lightest hair of her
head has suffered, by God! I&rsquo;ll burn this house to the
sills!&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>PAID</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Colonel Landcraft stood before Chadron
in his worn regimentals, his old campaign hat
turned back from his forehead as if he had been riding
in the face of a wind. Macdonald, looking up
at Frances from his couch, spoke to her with his
eyes. There was satisfaction in them, a triumphant
glow. She moved a step toward the door, and the
colonel, seeing her there, rushed to her and clasped
her against his dusty breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standing armed against you in your own house,
before your own wife and daughter!&rdquo; said he, turning
like the old tiger that he was upon Chadron
again. &ldquo;And in the presence of an officer of the
United States Army&mdash;my daughter, armed to protect
herself! By heaven, sir! you&rsquo;ve disgraced the
uniform you wear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major King, scowling darkly, dropped his hand
in suggestive gesture to his sword. Colonel Landcraft,
his slight, bony old frame drawn up to its utmost
inch, marched to him, fire in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbuckle that sword! You&rsquo;re not fit to wear it,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>Chadron had drawn away from the door of Macdonald&rsquo;s
room a little, and stood apart from Major
King with his wife and daughter. The cattleman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' ></a>299</span>
had attempted no defense, had said no word. In the
coming of Colonel Landcraft, full of authority,
strong and certain of hand, Chadron appeared to
know that his world was beginning to tumble about
his ears.</p>
<p>Now he stepped forward to interpose in behalf
of his tool and co-conspirator, in one last big bluff.
Major King fell back a stride before the charge of
the infuriated old colonel, which seemed to have a
threat of personal violence in it, the color sinking
out of his face, his hand still on his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What authority have you got to come into my
house givin&rsquo; orders?&rdquo; Chadron wanted to know.
&ldquo;Maybe your bluffin&rsquo; goes with some people, but it
don&rsquo;t go with me. You git to hell out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your place and time I&rsquo;ll talk to you, you
sneaking hound!&rdquo; Colonel Landcraft answered,
throwing Chadron one blasting look. &ldquo;Take off that
sword, surrender those arms! You are under arrest.&rdquo;
This to Major King, who stood scowling,
watching the colonel as if to ward an attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whose authority do you make this demand?&rdquo;
questioned Major King, insolently. &ldquo;I am not aware
that any command&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft turned his back upon him and
strode to the open door, through which the dismounted
troopers could be seen standing back a
respectful distance in the shaft of light that fell
through it. At his appearance there, at the sight
of that old battered hat and familiar uniform, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' ></a>300</span>
men lifted a cheer. Little tyrant that he was, hard-handed
and exacting, they knew him for a soldier
and a man. They knew, too, that their old colonel
had not been given a square deal in that business,
and they were glad to see him back.</p>
<p>The colonel acknowledged the greeting with a
salute, his old head held prouder at that moment
than he ever had carried it in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Snow!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>The sergeant hurried forward, stepped out into
the light, came up at salute with the alacrity of a
man who found pleasure in the service to be demanded
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a detail of six men into this room, disarm
Major King, and place him under guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel wheeled again to face Chadron and
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not under the obligation of explaining my
authority to enter this house to any man,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but for your satisfaction, madam, and in deference
to you, Miss Chadron, I will tell you that I was
recalled by the department on my way to Washington
and sent back to resume command of Fort
Shakie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron was biting his mustache like an angry
horse mouthing the bit. In the background a captain
and two lieutenants, who had arrived with Chadron
and King, stood doubtful, it seemed, of their
part in that last act of the cattleman&rsquo;s rough melodrama.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' ></a>301</span></div>
<p>Frances had returned to Macdonald&rsquo;s side, fearful
that the excitement might bring on a hemorrhage in
his wound. She stood soothing him with low, soft,
and unnecessary words, unconscious of their tenderness,
perhaps, in the stress of her anxiety. But that
they were appreciated was evident in the slow-stealing
smile that came over his worn, rugged face like a
breaking sun.</p>
<p>Major King surrendered his arms to the sergeant
with a petulant, lofty shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not through with you yet, you old cuss!&rdquo;
said Chadron. &ldquo;I never started out to git a man
but what I got him, and I&rsquo;ll git you. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chadron&rsquo;s voice caught in his throat. He stood
there looking toward the outside door, drawing his
breath like a man suffocating. Stealthily his hand
moved toward his revolver, while his wife and daughter,
even Frances, struck by a thrill of some undefined
terror, leaned and looked as Chadron was
looking, toward the open door.</p>
<p>A tall, gaunt, dark shaggy man was standing
there, an old flapping hat drooping over his scowling
eyes. He was a man with a great branching mustache,
and the under lid of one eye was drawn down
upon his cheek in a little point, as if caught by a surgical
hook and held ready for the knife; a man who
bent forward from the middle, as if from long habit of
skulking under cover of low-growing shrubs; an evil
man, whose foul soul cried of bloody deeds through
every feature of his leering face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' ></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that man! that man!&rdquo; cried Nola, in fearful,
wild scream.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron clasped her in her arms and turned
her defiant face toward the man in the door. He
was standing just as he had stood when they first
saw him, silent, still; as grim as the shadow of Saul
Chadron&rsquo;s sins.</p>
<p>The soldiers who stood around Major King looked
on with puzzled eyes; Colonel Landcraft frowned.
Macdonald from his cot could not see the door, but
he felt the sharp striking of those charged seconds.
Chadron moved to one side a little, his fixed eyes on
the man in the door, his hand nearer his revolver
now; so near that his fingers touched it, and now
it was in his hand with a sudden bright flash into the
light.</p>
<p>Two shots in that quiet room, one following the
other so closely that they seemed but a divided one;
two shots, delivered so quickly after Nola&rsquo;s awful
scream that no man could whip up his shocked nerves
to obedience fast enough to interpose. Saul Chadron
pitched forward, his hands clutching, his arms
outspread, and fell dead, his face groveling upon the
floor. Outside, the soldiers lifted Mark Thorn, a
bullet through his heart.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XXIII_TEARS_IN_THE_NIGHT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>TEARS IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>They buried Saul Chadron next day in a corner
of the garden by the river. And there was the
benediction of tender autumn sunshine over the place
where they laid him down, away from the turmoil of
his life, and the tangle of injustices that he left
behind.</p>
<p>But there was none to come forward and speak
for the body of Mark Thorn. The cowboys hid him
in the sage at the foot of a butte, as men go silently
and shadow-like to bury away a shame.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a heart-soreness over the
ranchhouse by the river as night fell upon it again.
Saul Chadron had been a great and noble man to
some who wept in its silent rooms as the gloaming
deepened into darkness over the garden, where the
last leaves of autumn were tugging at their anchorage
to sail away. Even Frances Landcraft in her
vigil beside Macdonald&rsquo;s cot felt pity for Chadron&rsquo;s
fall. She regretted, at least, that he had not gone
out of life more worthily.</p>
<p>Colonel Landcraft had gone up the river to carry
a new message to the homesteaders whose houses lay
in ashes. He had ridden to tell them that they could
build in security and live in peace. The surgeon had
returned to the post, but was coming again tomorrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' ></a>304</span>
Behind him he had left the happy assurance
that Macdonald would live.</p>
<p>Macdonald himself had added his own brave word
to bear out the doctor&rsquo;s prediction, as far as Frances
would permit him to speak. That was not above ten
words, whispered into her ear, inclined low to hear.
When he attempted to go beyond that, soft warm
fingers made a latch upon his lips.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron came down a little after dark, and
whispered at the door. Macdonald was sleeping, and
Frances went softly to tell her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nola&rsquo;s askin&rsquo; for you,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron told her,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s all heartbroke and moanin&rsquo; in her bed. If
you&rsquo;ll go to her, and comfort her a little, honey, I&rsquo;ll
take as good care of him as if he was my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was touched by the appeal for sympathy.
She could picture Nola, little fashioned by nature or
her life&rsquo;s experiences to bear grief, shuddering and
sobbing alone in the dark, and her heart went out to
her in all its generosity and large forgivingness.</p>
<p>Nola&rsquo;s room was dark for all except the night sky
at her window. Frances stood a moment in her door,
listening, believing from the silence that she must
have gone to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nola,&rdquo; she whispered, softly.</p>
<p>A little shivering sob was the answer. Frances
went in, and closed the door. Nola was lying face
downward on her pillow, like a child, and Frances
found on putting out her comforting hand that the
fickle little lady&rsquo;s bolster was wet with tears. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' ></a>305</span>
sat on the bedside and tried gently to turn Nola&rsquo;s
face toward her. That brought on a storm of tears
and moanings, and agonized burrowing of her face
into the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I feel so mean and wicked!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If
I hadn&rsquo;t been so deceitful and treacherous and&mdash;and&mdash;and
everything, maybe all this sorrow wouldn&rsquo;t
have come to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances said nothing. She had found one hot
hand, tear-wet from lying under Nola&rsquo;s cheek, and
this she held tenderly, feeling it best to let the tears
of penitence purge the sufferer&rsquo;s soul in their world-old
way. After a time Nola became quieter. She
shifted in the bed, and moved over to give Frances
more room, and put up her arms to draw her friend
down for the kiss of forgiveness which she knew
would not be denied.</p>
<p>Afterwards she sat up in bed, and brushed her hair
back from her throbbing forehead with her palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it aches and aches&mdash;<i>so!</i>&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bind a cold towel around it, dear; that always
used to ease it, you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my head, Frances&mdash;my heart, my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was better so, Frances understood. Penitence
that brings only a headache is like plating over brass;
it cannot long conceal the baseness of the thing that
lies beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is the only remedy for that, Nola,&rdquo; she
said, her own words slow and sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ve sinned past forgiveness because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' ></a>306</span>
I&mdash;because&mdash;I love him?&rdquo; Nola&rsquo;s voice
trembled with earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is free, to love and be loved as it may fall,
Nola. I told you he was mine, but I thought then
that I was claiming him from death. He will live.
He never has asked me to marry him; maybe he
never will. When he recovers, he may turn to you&mdash;who
can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only you that he thinks of, Frances.
When I was watching by him he opened his eyes,
and you should have seen the look in them when he
saw me instead of you. He struggled to sit up and
look for you, and he called your name, sharp and
frightened, as if he thought somebody had taken
you away from him forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances did not need that assurance to quiet any
fear of his loyalty. She had spoken the truth, only
because it was the truth, but not to give Nola hope.
For hope she knew there was not any, nor any love,
to come to Nola out of that man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not talk of it,&rdquo; Frances said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must, I can&rsquo;t let anything stand between us,
Frances. If I&rsquo;d been fair, all the way through&mdash;but
I wasn&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t fair about Major King, and I
wasn&rsquo;t fair this time. I was fool enough to think
that if you were out of the way for a little while I
could make him love me! He&rsquo;d never love me, never
in a million years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances said nothing. But she was beginning to
doubt the sincerity of Nola&rsquo;s repentance. There,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' ></a>307</span>
under the shadow of her bereavement, she could think
of nothing but the hopelessness of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want you to come up just to pet
me and be good to me, Frances&mdash;I wanted to give
you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nola felt under her pillow, and groped for Frances&rsquo;
hand, in which she placed a soft something with a
stub of a feather in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no right to keep it,&rdquo; said Nola. &ldquo;Do
you know what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the softness which Frances had for the
highland bonnet was in her voice as she replied, and
the little bonnet itself was being nestled against her
cheek, as a mother cuddles a baby&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best that&rsquo;s in me goes out to that man,&rdquo;
said Nola solemnly&mdash;and truthfully, Frances knew&mdash;&ldquo;but
I wouldn&rsquo;t take him from you now, Frances,
even if I could. I don&rsquo;t want to care for him, I don&rsquo;t
want to think of him. I just want to think of poor
father lying out there under the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best for you to think of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a day ago he was alive and warm, like you
and me, and now he&rsquo;s dead! Mother never will want
to leave this place again now, and I don&rsquo;t feel like
I want to either. I just want to lie down and die&mdash;oh,
I just want to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pity for herself brought Nola&rsquo;s tears gushing
again, and her choking sobs into her throat. Her
voice was hoarse from her lamentations; there seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' ></a>308</span>
to be only sorrow for her in every theme. Frances
held her shivering slim body in her supporting arm,
and Nola&rsquo;s face bent down upon her shoulder. It
seemed that her renunciation was complete, her regeneration
undeniable. But Frances knew that a
great flood of tears was required to put out the fire
of passion in a woman&rsquo;s heart. One spark, one little
spark, might live through the deluge to spring into
the heat of the past under the breath of memory.</p>
<p>Again the heaving breast grew calm, and the tear-wet
face was lifted to shake back the fallen hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has emptied everything out for me,&rdquo; Nola
sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be serious in everything, with
everybody, after this. Do you suppose Mrs.
Mathews would let me help her over at the mission&mdash;if
I went to her meek and humble and asked her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she saw that it would help <i>you</i>, she would,
Nola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think how lonesome it will be here when the
post&rsquo;s abandoned and everybody but the Indians
gone! You&rsquo;ll be away&mdash;maybe long before that&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll not see anybody but Indians and cowboys
from year&rsquo;s beginning to year&rsquo;s end. Oh, it will be
so dreary and lonesome here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s work up the river in the homesteaders&rsquo;
settlement, Nola; there&rsquo;s suffering to be relieved, and
bereaved hearts to be comforted. There&rsquo;s your work,
it seems to me, for you and those nearest to you are
to blame for the desolation of those poor homes,
excuse it as charitably as we may.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' ></a>309</span></div>
<p>Frances felt a shudder run through the girl&rsquo;s body
as her arm clasped the pliant waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Frances! You can&rsquo;t mean that! They&rsquo;re
terrible&mdash;just think what they&rsquo;ve done&mdash;oh, the
underhanded thieves! By the law of the range it&rsquo;s
my fight now, instead of my work to help them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law of the range isn&rsquo;t the law any longer
here, Nola, and it never will be again. Alan Macdonald
has done the work that he put his lone hand
to. You have no quarrel with anybody, child, no
feud to carry on to a bloody end. Put it out of your
mind. If you are sincere in your heart, and truly
penitent, you can prove it best by beginning to do
good in the place where your house has done a terrible,
sad wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They started it!&rdquo; said Nola, vindictively, the
lifelong hatred for those who encroached upon the
range so deep in her breast, it seemed, that the soil
of her life must come away on its roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use talking to you about it, then,&rdquo;
said Frances, coldly.</p>
<p>Nola seemed hurt by her tone. She began to cry
again, and plead her cause in moaning, broken words.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our country, we were here first&mdash;father always
said that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t blame Mr. Macdonald, they deceived
him, the rustlers deceived him and told him lies. He
didn&rsquo;t belong to this country, he couldn&rsquo;t know at
first, or understand. Frances&rdquo;&mdash;she put her hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' ></a>310</span>
on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder, and lifted her head as if
trying to pierce the dark and look into her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you know how it was with him? He was too
much of a man to turn his back on them, even when
he found he was on the wrong side. A man like him
<i>must</i> have understood it our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he has done in this country calls for no
excuse,&rdquo; returned Frances, loftily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your eyes and mine he wouldn&rsquo;t need any
excuse for anything he might do,&rdquo; said Nola, with
a sagacity unexpected. &ldquo;We love him, and we&rsquo;d
love him, right or wrong. Well&rdquo;&mdash;a sigh&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got a right to love him, and I haven&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t try
to make him care for me now if I could, for I&rsquo;m
different; I&rsquo;m all emptied out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes more than you&rsquo;ve gone through to empty
a human life, Nola. But you have no right to love
him; honor and honesty are in the way, friendship
not considered at all. You&rsquo;ll spring up in the sun
again after a little while, like fresh grass that&rsquo;s trodden
on, just as happy and light-hearted as before.
Let me have this one without any more interference&mdash;there
are plenty in the world that you would stand
heart-high to with your bright little head, just as
well as Alan Macdonald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give him up, the thought of him, and the
longing for him, without regret, Frances; I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you do it. I want you to have
regret, and pain&mdash;not too deep nor too lasting, but
some corrective pain. Now, go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' ></a>311</span></div>
<p>Frances pressed her back to the pillow, and
touched her head with light caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances,&rdquo; she whispered, a new gladness dawning
in her voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see those poor people,
and try to help them&mdash;if they&rsquo;ll let me. Maybe we
<i>were</i> wrong&mdash;partly, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Frances encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll try not to care for him, or think about
him, even one little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances bent and kissed her. Nola&rsquo;s arms clung
to her neck a little, holding her while she whispered
in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I&rsquo;m going to be different, I&rsquo;m going to be
good&mdash;abso-<i>lutely</i> good!&rdquo;</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XXIV_BANJO_FACES_INTO_THE_WEST'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>BANJO FACES INTO THE WEST</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me? So the old colonel&rsquo;s got
what his heart&rsquo;s been pinin&rsquo; for many a year.
Well, well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron was beside her window in her favored
rocker again, less assertive of bulk in her black
dress, not so florid of face, and with lines of sadness
about her mouth and eyes. A fire was snapping in
the chimney, for the gray sky was driving a bitter
wind, and the first snowflakes of winter were straying
down.</p>
<p>Banjo Gibson was before the fire, his ears red, his
cheeks redder, just in from a brisk ride over from
the post. His instruments lay beside him on the
floor, and he was limbering his fingers close to the
blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a brigamadier now,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brigadier-General Landcraft,&rdquo; said she, musingly,
looking away into the grayness of the day;
&ldquo;well, maybe he deserves it. Fur as I&rsquo;m concerned,
he&rsquo;s welcome to it, and I&rsquo;m glad for Frances&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s vinegar and red pepper, that old man is!
Takin&rsquo; him up both sides and down the middle, as
the feller said, I reckon the colonel&mdash;or brigamadier,
I guess they&rsquo;ll call him now&mdash;he&rsquo;s about as good as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' ></a>313</span>
they make &rsquo;em. I always did have a kind of a likin&rsquo;
for that old feller&mdash;he&rsquo;s something like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nice of you to come over and tell me the
news, anyhow, Banjo; you&rsquo;re always as obligin&rsquo; and
thoughtful as you can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been a happiness and a pleasure,
mom, and I&rsquo;ve come a good many times with news,
sad and joyful, to your door. But I reckon it&rsquo;ll be
many a long day before I come ridin&rsquo; to Alamito with
news ag&rsquo;in; many a long, long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Banjo? You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Californy; startin&rsquo; from here as soon as my
horse blows a spell and eats his last feed at your
feed box, mom. I&rsquo;ve got to make it to Meander to
ketch the mornin&rsquo; train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Banjo! you don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; Tears gushed
to Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s eyes, used to so much weeping
now, and her lips trembled as she pressed them hard
to keep back a sob. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last friend of the
old times, the last face outside of this house belongin&rsquo;
to the old days. When you&rsquo;re gone my last friend,
the very last one I care about outside of my own, &rsquo;ll
be gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo cleared his throat unsteadily, and looked
very hard at the fire for quite a spell before he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of friends must part,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they must part,&rdquo; she admitted, her handkerchief
pressed to her eyes, her voice muffled behind
it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' ></a>314</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But they ain&rsquo;t no use of me stayin&rsquo; around in
this country and pinin&rsquo; for what&rsquo;s gone, and starvin&rsquo;
on the edge,&rdquo; said Banjo, briskly. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve
sold out the cattle and the boys is all gone, scattered
ever-which-ways and to Texas, and the homesteaders
is comin&rsquo; into this valley as thick as blackbirds, it
ain&rsquo;t no place for me. I don&rsquo;t mix with them kind
of people, I never did. You&rsquo;ve give it all up to &rsquo;em,
they tell me, but this homestead, mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but the homestead,&rdquo; she sighed, her tears
checked now, her eyes on the farthest hill, where she
had watched the crest many and many a time for Saul
to rise over it, riding home from Meander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t ort to let it go,&rdquo; said he, shaking his
sad head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;a&rsquo;held it, the lawyers and Mr. Macdonald
told me that. It&rsquo;s public land, Banjo, it belongs
to them folks, I reckon. But we was here
first!&rdquo; A futile sigh, a regretful sigh, a sigh bitter
with old recollections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s so, down to the bottom of it,
but you folks made this country what it was, and
by rights it&rsquo;s yourn. Well, I stopped in to say
good-bye to the old brigamadier-colonel over at the
post as I come through. He tells me Alan and that
little girl of hisn that stuck to him and stood up for
him through thick and thin &rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be married
at Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll be leavin&rsquo;, too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to build on his ranch up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' ></a>315</span>
river and stay here, and that old brigamadier-colonel
he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to take up land next to &rsquo;em, or has
took it up, one of the two, and retire from the army
when they&rsquo;re married. He says this country&rsquo;s the
breath of his body and he couldn&rsquo;t live outside of
it, he&rsquo;s been here so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said she, her face brightening a
little at the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Alan by now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up and around&mdash;he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to leave us in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frances here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she went over home this morning&mdash;I thought
maybe you met her&mdash;but she&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; back for him
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo sat musing a little while. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll have neighbors, mom, plenty of &rsquo;em.
A colony of nesters is comin&rsquo; here, three or four
hundred of &rsquo;em, they tell me, all ready to go to puttin&rsquo;
up schoolhouses and go to plowin&rsquo; in the spring.
And they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to run that hell-snortin&rsquo; railroad
right up this valley. I reckon it&rsquo;ll cut right along
here somewheres a&rsquo;past your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, changes&rsquo;ll come, Banjo, changes is bound
to come,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All over this country, they say, the nesters&rsquo;ll
squat now wherever they want to, and nobody
won&rsquo;t dast to take a shot at &rsquo;em to drive &rsquo;em off of
his grass. They put so much in the papers about
this rustlers&rsquo; war up here that folks has got it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' ></a>316</span>
through &rsquo;em the nesters ain&rsquo;t been gittin&rsquo; what was
comin&rsquo; to &rsquo;em. The big ranches &rsquo;ll all be split up to
flinders inside of five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the cattle days is passin&rsquo;, along with the
folks that was somebody in this country once. Well,
Banjo, we had some good times in the old days; we
can remember them. But changes will come, we must
expect changes. You don&rsquo;t need to pack up and go
on account of that. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to feel
tight in the chist already for lack of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both sat silent a little while. Banjo&rsquo;s elbows were
across his knees, his face lifted toward the window.
The wind was falling, and there was a little breaking
among the low clouds, baring a bit of blue sky here
and there. Banjo viewed this brightening of the day
with gladness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s passin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, going to the window
and peering round as much of the horizon as
he could see, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t nothing but a little shakin&rsquo;
out of the tablecloth after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it, for I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good luck
to start out on a trip in a storm. That there Nola
she&rsquo;s out in it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone up the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It beats all how she&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; up with them
people, and them with her. She&rsquo;s even bought lumber
with her own money to help some of &rsquo;em build.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a heart like a dove,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soft as a puddin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mrs. Chadron nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' ></a>317</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I never could git to it.&rdquo; Banjo sighed again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron shook her head, with an expression
of sadness for his failure which was deeper than any
words she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss of her pa bore down on her terrible;
she&rsquo;s pinin&rsquo; and grievin&rsquo; too hard for a body so
young. I hear her cryin&rsquo; and moanin&rsquo; in the night
sometimes, and I know it ain&rsquo;t no use goin&rsquo; to her,
for I&rsquo;ve tried. She seems to need something more
than an old woman like me can give, but I don&rsquo;t know
what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she needs a change&mdash;a change of air,&rdquo;
Banjo suggested, with what vague hope only himself
could tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe she does. Well, you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
take a change of air, anyhow, Banjo. But what&rsquo;re
you goin&rsquo; to do away out there amongst strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was out there one time, five years ago, and
didn&rsquo;t seem to like it then. But since I&rsquo;ve stood off
and thought it over, it seems to me that&rsquo;s a better
place for me than here, with my old friends goin&rsquo; or
gone, and things changin&rsquo; this a-way. Out there
around them hop and fruit ranches they have great
times at night in the camps, and a man of my build
can keep busy playin&rsquo; for dances. I done it before,
and they took to me, right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do everywheres, Banjo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he sighed, watching out of the window
in the direction that Nola must come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not likely to come back before morning&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' ></a>318</span>
think she aims to go to the post tonight and stay with
Frances,&rdquo; she said, reading his heart in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s for the best,&rdquo; said Banjo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess everything that comes to us is for the
best, if we knew how to take it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well,
you set there and be comfortable, and I&rsquo;ll stir Maggie
up and have her make you something nice for dinner.
After that I want you to play me the old songs over
before you go. Just to think I&rsquo;ll never hear them
songs no more breaks my heart, Banjo&mdash;plumb
breaks my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she passed Banjo she laid her hand on his head
in a manner of benediction, and tears were in her
eyes.</p>
<p>The sun was out again when they had finished
lunch, coaxing autumn on into November at the peril
of frosted toes. Mrs. Chadron had brightened considerably,
also. Even bereavement and sorrow could
not shake her fealty to chili, and now it was rewarding
her by a rubbing of her old color in her face as
she sat by the window and waited for Banjo to tune
his instruments for the parting songs.</p>
<p>Her workbasket was beside her, the bright knitting-needles
in the unfinished sock. It never would
be completed now, she knew, but she kept it by her
to cry over in the twilight hours, when thoughts of
Saul came over her with their deep-harrowing pangs.</p>
<p>Banjo sang the touching old ballads over to her
appreciative ear, watching the shadows outside, as he
played, for three o&rsquo;clock. That was the hour set for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' ></a>319</span>
him to go. &ldquo;Silver Threads&rdquo; was saved for the end,
and when its last strain died Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s face was
hidden in her hands. She was rocking gently, her
handkerchief fallen to the floor.</p>
<p>Banjo put his bow in its place in the lid of the
case, the rosin in its little box. But the fiddle he
still held on his knee, stroking its smooth back with
loving hand, as if he would soothe Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s
regrets and longings and back-tugging pains by that
vicarious caress. So he sat petting his instrument,
and after a little she looked at him, her eyes red, and
tear-streaks on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it away just yet, Banjo,&rdquo; she requested;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s another one I want you to sing,
and that will be the last. It&rsquo;s the saddest one you
play&mdash;one that I couldn&rsquo;t stand one time&mdash;do you
remember?&rdquo; Banjo remembered; he nodded. &ldquo;I can
stand it now, Banjo; I want to hear it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo drew bow again, no more words on either
side, and began his song:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>All o-lone and sad he left me,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>But no oth-o&rsquo;s bride I&rsquo;ll be;</p>
<p>For in flow-os he bedecked me,</p>
<p><span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>In tho cottage by tho sea.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>When he finished, Mrs. Chadron&rsquo;s head was bent
upon her arm across the little workstand where her
basket stood. Her shoulders were moving in piteous
convulsions, but no sound of crying came from her.
Banjo knew that it was the hardest kind of weeping
that tears the human heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' ></a>320</span></div>
<p>He put away his fiddle, and strapped the case.
Then he went to her and laid his hand on her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be saddlin&rsquo; up, mom,&rdquo; said he, his
own voice thick, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll say <i>adios</i> to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Banjo, and may God bless you in that
country you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to so fur away from the friends
you used to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banjo&rsquo;s throat moved as he gulped his sorrow.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not come back in the house, but I&rsquo;ll wave you
good-bye from the gate,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hopes you might change your mind,
Banjo,&rdquo; she said, as she took his hand and held it a
little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could&rsquo;a&rsquo;got to somebody&rsquo;s heart that I&rsquo;ve
pined for many a day, I would&rsquo;a&rsquo;changed my mind,
mom. But it wasn&rsquo;t to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t to be, Banjo,&rdquo; she said, shaking her
head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll ever marry&mdash;she&rsquo;s
changed, she&rsquo;s so changed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>adios</i> to you, mom, and the best of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adios</i>, Banjo, boy; good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited at the window for him to pass the gate.
He appeared there leading his horse, and bent to
examine the girths before putting foot to the stirrup.
She hoped that he was coming back, to tell her that
he could not find it in his heart to go. But no; the
change that was coming over the cattle country was
like an unfriendly wind to the little troubadour.
His way was staked into the west where new ties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' ></a>321</span>
waited him, where new hearts were to be won. He
mounted, turned to the window, waved his hat and
rode away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chadron sat in her old place and watched him
until he passed beyond the last hill line and out of
her sight. Her last glimpse of him had been in
water lines through tears. Now she reached for her
basket and took out her unfinished knitting. Broken
off there, like her own life it was, she thought, never
to be completed as designed. The old days were done;
the promise of them only partly fulfilled. She was
bidding farewell to more than Banjo, parting with
more than friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Banjo,&rdquo; she murmured, looking dimly
toward the farthest hill; &ldquo;<i>adios!</i>&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'>&ldquo;HASTA LUEGO&rdquo;</span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Frances came into the room as fresh as a
morning-glory. Her cheeks were like peonies,
and the fire of her youth and strength danced in her
happy eyes. Macdonald rose to greet her, tall,
gaunt, and pale from the drain that his wound had
made upon his life. He had been smoking before
the fireplace, and he reached up now to put his pipe
away on the manteltree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are things at the post?&rdquo; he asked, as
she stood before him in her saddle dress, her sombrero
pressing down her hair, her quirt swinging by
its thong from her gloved wrist.</p>
<p>Before replying she intercepted the hand that was
reaching to stow the pipe away, pressed it firmly
back, inserted the stem between his close lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this family, the man smokes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>His slow smile, which was reward enough to her
for all the trouble that it took to wake it, twinkled
in his eyes like someone coming to the window with a
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the piece of a man will go ahead and
smoke,&rdquo; said he, drawing a chair up beside his own
and leading her to it with gentle pressure upon her
hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' ></a>323</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mrs. Chadron been overfeeding you while
I was gone? Did she give you chili?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>offered</i> me chili, in five different dishes, which
I, remembering the injunction, regretfully put aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re coming with the ambulance, I rode
on ahead, and you&rsquo;ll soon be beyond the peril of
chili.&rdquo; She smiled as she looked up into his face,
and the smile broadened into an outright laugh when
she saw the little flitting cloud of vexation there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could well enough ride,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor says you could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as fit for the saddle this minute as I ever was
in my life,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>She made no reply to that in words. But there
was tender pity in her caressing eyes as they measured
the weakness of his thin arms, wasted down to
tendon and bone now, it seemed. He would ride to
the post, she knew very well, if permitted, and come
through it without a murmur. But the risk would
be foolish, no matter what his pride must suffer by
going in a wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news from Meander?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, news comes slowly to Alamito Ranch, and
will come slower now that Banjo is gone, Mrs. Chadron
says. What&rsquo;s been happening at Meander?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They held their conventions there last week to
nominate county officers, and what do you think?
They&rsquo;ve nominated you for something, for&mdash;for
<i>what</i> do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' ></a>324</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nominated me? Who&rsquo;s nominated me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one party or the other began it, and the
other indorsed you, for&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, Frances?&rdquo; he asked, laughter in his
eyes at her unaccountable way of holding back on
the secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for <i>sheriff!</i>&rdquo; said she, with magnificent
scorn.</p>
<p>Macdonald leaned back in his chair and laughed,
the first audible sound of merriment that she ever
had heard come from those stern lips. She looked
at him with reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should have been governor, the very least they
could have done, decently!&rdquo; She was full of feeling
on the subject of what she believed to be his undervaluation.</p>
<p>Macdonald took her hand, the laughter dying out
of his sober face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all in the different ways of looking at a
man, <i>palomita</i>,&rdquo; he said to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you look bigger than <i>sheriff</i> to anybody!&rdquo;
she replied, indignation large in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this country, Frances, a sheriff is a pretty
sizable man,&rdquo; he said, his thoughtful eyes on the
fire, &ldquo;about the biggest man they can conceive, next
only to the president himself. Up here in the cattle
country the greatness of men is dimmed, their magnitude
being measured by appreciable results. The
offices of lawmaker, governor, and such as the outside
world invest with their peculiar dignity, are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' ></a>325</span>
incidental, indefinite&mdash;all but negative, here. It&rsquo;s
different with a sheriff. He&rsquo;s the man who comes
riding with his guns at his side; they can see him
perform. All the law that they know centers in
him; all branches of government, as they understand
his powers. Yes, a sheriff is something of a figure
in this county, Frances, and to be nominated for that
office by one party and indorsed by another is just
about the biggest compliment a man can receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Alan, you&rsquo;ll not accept it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think so,&rdquo; he returned, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;d be worth more to this county as sheriff
than I would be as&mdash;as governor, let us say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they go shooting sheriffs,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not be doing so much careless and easy
shooting around here since Colonel&mdash;Brigadier-General
Landcraft&mdash;and that sounds more like his size,
too&mdash;gave them a rubdown with the iron hand. The
cattle barons&rsquo; day is over; their sun went down when
Mark Thorn brought the holy scare to Saul Chadron&rsquo;s
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father is of the same opinion. Do you know,
Alan, the whole story about that horrible old man
Thorn is in the eastern papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a Cheyenne date-line,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;the
whole story&mdash;who hired him to skulk and kill, and a
list of his known crimes. Father says if there was
anything lacking in the fight you made on the cattlemen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' ></a>326</span>
this would finish them. It&rsquo;s a terrible story&mdash;poor
Nola read it, and learned for the first time her
father&rsquo;s connection with Thorn. She&rsquo;s humiliated
and heartbroken over it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With sufficient reason,&rdquo; he nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid her mother will hear of it in some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find it out in time, Frances; a thing like
that walks on a man&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not matter so much after a while, after
her first grief settles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Nola come back with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she went on to take some things to poor old
Mrs. Lassiter. She never has recovered from the loss
of her son&mdash;it&rsquo;s killing her by inches, Tom says.
And you considering that office of sheriff!&rdquo; She
turned to him with censorious eyes as she spoke, as
if struck with a pain of which he was the cause. &ldquo;I
tell you, you men don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t know! It&rsquo;s
the women that suffer in all this shooting and killing&mdash;we
are the ones that have to bear the sorrows in
the night and watch through the uncertain days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he gently, &ldquo;the poor women must bear
most of this world&rsquo;s pain. That is why God made
them strong above all his created things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat in silence, thinking it over between them.
Outside there was sunshine over the brown rangeland;
within there dwelt the lifting confidence that their
feet had passed the days of trouble and were entering
the bounds of an enlarging peace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' ></a>327</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And Major King?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has relented, as I knew he would, out of
regard for their friendship of the past, and will not
bring charges based on Major King&rsquo;s plottings with
Chadron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that way,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;Do you suppose
there&rsquo;s nothing between him and Nola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll have him after her grief passes,
Alan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than he deserves,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
lump of gold in that little lady&rsquo;s heart, Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, Alan; I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that.&rdquo;
There was moisture in her tender eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something in that man, too,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that he allowed his desire
to humiliate you and me to drive him into such folly.
If he&rsquo;d only have held those brigands here for the
civil authorities, as I requested, we could have forgotten
the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father says that would have saved him in
his eyes, in spite of his scheming with Chadron
against your life, and against father&rsquo;s honor and all
that he holds sacred. But it&rsquo;s done, and he&rsquo;s genuinely
despised in the service for it. And there&rsquo;s the
ambulance coming over the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ambulance for me!&rdquo; said he, in disgust of his
slow mending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad that it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, nodding his slow, grave head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to say good-bye to Mrs. Chadron,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' ></a>328</span>
said she, bustling around, or making a show of doing
so to hide the tears which had sprung into her eyes
at the thought that it might have been a different
sort of conveyance coming to Alamito to take Alan
Macdonald away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Alamito,&rdquo; said he, looking out into the
frost-stricken garden with a tenderness in his eyes.
&ldquo;I shall always have a softness in my heart for
Alamito, because it gave me you. That garden out
there yielded me the dearest flower that any garden
ever gave a man&rdquo;&mdash;he took her hands, and folded
them above his heart&mdash;&ldquo;a flower with a soul in it
to keep it alive forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head as he spoke, as if receiving a
benediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate saying good-bye to Mrs. Chadron,&rdquo; she
said, her voice trembling, &ldquo;for she&rsquo;ll cry, and I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ll cry, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be farewell, only <i>hasta luego</i><a  id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a> we can
assure her of that. We&rsquo;ll be neighbors to her, for
this is home, dear heart, this is our <i>val paraiso</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our valley of paradise,&rdquo; she nodded, her hands
reaching up to his shoulders and clinging there a
moment in soft caress, &ldquo;our home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arm about her shoulders, he faced her to the
window, and pointed to the hills, asleep now in their
brown winter coat behind a clear film of smoky blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood up there one evening, weighted down with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' ></a>329</span>
guns and ammunition, hunting and hunted in the
most desperate game I ever played,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
sun was low over this valley, and Alamito was a
gleam of white among the autumn gold. I was tired,
hungry, dusty, thirsty and sore, and my heart was
all but dead in its case. That was after you had
sent me away from the post, scorned and half
despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rebuke me for that night now, Alan,&rdquo; she
pleaded, turning her pained eyes to his. &ldquo;I have
suffered for my injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t injustice, it was discipline, and it was
good for both of us. We must come to confidence
through misunderstandings and false charges very
frequently in this life. Never mind that; I was telling
you about that evening on the side of the hill. I
had been sitting with my back to a rock, watching the
brush for Mark Thorn, but I was thinking more of
you than of him. For he meant only death, and you
were life. But I thought that I had lost you that
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew nearer to him as they stood, in the unequivocal
consolation of her presence, in the most
comforting refutation of that sad hour&rsquo;s dark forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that, until I stood up and started down
the slope to go my lone-handed way. The sun struck
me in the face then, and it was yellow over the valley,
and the wind was glad. I knew then, when I looked
out over it, that it held something for me, that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' ></a>330</span>
was my country, and my home. The lines of gray
old Joaquin Miller came to me, and lifted my heart
in a new vision. I said them over to myself:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Lo! these are the isles of the watery miles</p>
<p>That God let down from the firmament.</p>
<p>Lo! Duty and Love, and a true man&rsquo;s trust;</p>
<p>Your forehead to God and your feet in the dust&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>only, there were two lines which I did not repeat, I
dared not repeat, even in my heart. My vision halted
short of their fulfillment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the words&mdash;do you remember them?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I can repeat them now, for my vision is
broader, it is a better dream:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Lo! Duty and Love, and a sweet babe&rsquo;s smiles,</p>
<p>And there, O friend, are the Fortunate Isles.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>He pressed her closer, and kissed her hair. They
stood, unmindful of the waiting ambulance, their
vision fusing in the blue distances of the land their
hearts held dear. It was home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Alan&rdquo;&mdash;she started from her reverie
and drew him by the hand&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s Mrs. Chadron
on the porch, waiting for <i>hasta luego</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For <i>hasta luego</i>,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
